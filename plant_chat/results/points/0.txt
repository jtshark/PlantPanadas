User1:
This diagram is quite good. The naming of methods, classes and attributes is clear and relevant. The simplicity of the diagram is maintained and it is easy to understand. The types of attributes used are also appropriate. The diagram also correctly represents the original task. The relationships between classes are also correctly used. However, it lacks the classes for "Order" and "Inventory", which are important for the system. Therefore, I would rate it as 8/10.

This student's work is divided into several diagrams, which makes it harder to grasp the overall system. The naming of methods, classes, and attributes is clear and relevant. The types of attributes used are also appropriate. However, the diagrams lack details, especially the "Inquiry", "Inventory", "Order", and "Review" classes are left empty. The relationships between classes are also correctly used. I would rate it as 6/10 due to the lack of details and complexity of multiple diagrams.

The types of attributes used are also appropriate. The diagram also correctly represents the original task. The relationships between classes are also correctly used. However, the diagram lacks the class for "Inventory", which is important for the system. And the "Admin" class is represented as a subclass of "User", which may not be accurate as they have different roles. Therefore, I would rate it as 7/10.
