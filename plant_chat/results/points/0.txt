The student has done a good job in naming methods and classes according to the task. The simplicity of the diagram is also commendable. However, the student has not provided any attributes or methods for the Inquiry, Inventory, Order, and Review classes. The relationships between classes are correctly used.

This student has done a great job in naming the classes, methods, and attributes. The diagram is simple and easy to understand. The types of attributes used are correct and relevant to the task. The relationships between classes are also correctly used. However, there is a redundant relationship between the Book and Inventory classes which could have been avoided.

The student has done well in naming the classes and methods. However, the attributes used are not typed, which could lead to confusion. The diagram is simple and easy to understand. The relationships between classes are correctly used, but the inheritance relationship between Admin and User might not be necessary according to the task.
