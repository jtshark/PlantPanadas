The diagram is quite comprehensive and covers most of the requirements. The classes are well defined with both attributes and methods. The relationships between the classes are well represented. However, there is no representation of the order process which is a key part of any online bookstore.

The diagram is very detailed and covers all the requirements. The classes are well defined with attributes and methods. The relationships between the classes are well represented. The inclusion of an Order class is good as it represents the order process. However, the Admin class could be better defined with attributes.

The diagrams are broken down into separate files which makes it easier to understand each class and their relationships. However, the diagrams are not complete. Some of the classes like Inquiry, Order, Review, and Inventory have no attributes or methods defined. The relationships are well represented but the diagrams could be better organized.
