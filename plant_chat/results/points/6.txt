User1: I would give a score of 7. The diagram is simple and the methods and classes are named appropriately. The relationships between classes are also correct. However, the attributes of the classes are missing. The Artist class has methods that are not mentioned in the original task, such as performConcert().

User2: I would give a score of 9. The diagram is more complex but it covers all aspects of the original task. The naming of classes, methods, and attributes is appropriate. The relationships between classes are correct. The only missing part is the relation between the MusicLabel and Album. Also, the RoyaltyPayment class seems to be over-engineered.

User3: I would give a score of 6. The diagrams are simple and the naming of classes, methods, and attributes is appropriate. However, the diagrams are split into multiple files, which makes it harder to understand the overall system. The relationships between classes are missing. The User class does not have methods related to the music streaming app, such as listenToSong(), createPlaylist(), and followArtist().
