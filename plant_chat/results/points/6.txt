User2: 

Score: 9/10

Explanation: The student has a very good understanding of the system. The classes are well defined with attributes and methods. The relationships between the classes are also well defined. However, the model lacks some details, such as the relationship between songs and artists, and between songs and albums.

User3: 

Score: 7/10

Explanation: The student has a good understanding of the system and has modeled the main classes well. However, the relationships between the classes are missing, which makes the model incomplete. Also, the classes are scattered across multiple diagrams, which makes it harder to understand the overall system.
