User1: 7/10
The user has done a good job in creating separate class diagrams for each class, and the naming of methods and attributes is clear and understandable. However, the user has missed out on some important aspects of the problem statement such as the relationships between classes, and the management of albums and artists by the music labels. The user also did not include any associations or dependencies between the classes in the diagrams.

User2: 9/10
The user has created a comprehensive UML class diagram that includes all the classes mentioned in the problem statement. The naming of methods and attributes is clear and understandable. The user has also correctly identified the relationships between the classes, and has included methods for managing artists and albums in the MusicLabel class. The user has also included a RoyaltyPayment class, which was not explicitly mentioned in the problem statement, but is a logical inclusion given the task of managing royalty payments. The user could improve the diagram by specifying the multiplicity of the relationships between the classes.
