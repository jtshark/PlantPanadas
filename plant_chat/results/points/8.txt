The naming of methods, classes, and attributes is very clear and self-explanatory. The diagram is simple and easy to understand. The types of attributes used are appropriate and relevant to the classes. The diagram is mostly correct to the original task, but it lacks a communication system between team members. The relationships between classes are correctly used. The use of inheritance in Player class is a good touch.

The diagram is well-organized and simple. The naming of classes, methods, and attributes is mostly clear, but the role of 'Member' is a bit vague. The types of attributes used are appropriate. The diagram is mostly correct to the original task, but it lacks explicit player positions and individual player statistics. The relationships between classes are correctly used.

The diagram is simple and easy to understand. The naming of classes, methods, and attributes is clear. The types of attributes used are appropriate. However, the diagram is not entirely correct to the original task. It lacks a system for managing game schedules and it does not show how statistics are related to games. The relationships between classes are correctly used.
