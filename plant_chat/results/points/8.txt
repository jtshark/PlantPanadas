The diagram is simple and easy to understand. The naming of methods, classes, and attributes is good. The types of attributes used are also appropriate. The diagram correctly represents the original task, and the use of relationships between classes is correct. However, the diagram could be improved by adding methods to the classes.

The diagram is a bit complex and could be simplified. The naming of methods, classes, and attributes is good. The types of attributes used are appropriate. The diagram correctly represents the original task, and the use of relationships between classes is correct. However, the diagram could be improved by adding more specific classes for different types of team members (e.g., players, coaches).
