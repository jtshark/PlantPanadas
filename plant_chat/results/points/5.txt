User1: 7/10
The student has correctly identified the main classes and their methods. However, the student has not included any attributes for the User and CharityOrganizer classes, which would be necessary to identify and manage these entities. The student has also not included any relationships between the classes, which would be necessary to model the interactions between different entities in the system.

User2: 9/10
The student has done a very good job of breaking down the system into separate classes, each with its own attributes and methods. The student has also included a Relationship class to model the relationship between a charity organizer and a campaign, which is a nice touch. However, the student has not included any relationships between the classes in their diagrams, which would be necessary to model the interactions between different entities in the system.

User3: 8/10
The student has correctly identified the main classes, their attributes, and their methods. The student has also included relationships between the classes, which is good. However, the student has not included any methods for the User class to discover causes or for the Charity class to manage donor relationships, which were part of the original problem statement.
