User1:
Score: 8.5/10
Explanation: The diagram is simple and easy to understand. The naming of methods and classes is clear and relevant. The types of attributes used are appropriate and the relationships between classes are correctly used. However, the Charity class should have a method to manage donor relationships, and the User class should have a method to discover causes, which are part of the original task.

User2:
Score: 7/10
Explanation: The classes and methods are well named and the types of attributes used are suitable. However, the diagram is not simple as it is divided into several parts and the relationships between classes are not shown. Also, there are missing methods such as discovering causes and tracking the impact of donations for the User class, and managing donor relationships for the Organizer class, which are required in the original task.

User3:
Score: 9/10
Explanation: The diagram is simple and the naming of methods and classes is clear. The types of attributes used are relevant. The relationships between classes are correctly used. The diagram also correctly represents the original task. However, the User class is missing a method to track the impact of their contributions and the Cause class should not have methods to create, edit, and delete a cause, these should be under the CharityOrganizer class.
