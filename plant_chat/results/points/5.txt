User1: 7/10
The student has correctly identified the main classes and their relationships. The naming of methods and classes is clear and relevant. However, the class "User" does not include methods for discovering causes, which was part of the task. The class "Charity" includes a method for creating campaigns, which should be the responsibility of a separate "CharityOrganizer" class. The simplicity of the diagram is good, and the types of attributes used are appropriate.

User2: 8/10
The student has correctly identified the main classes and their relationships. The naming of methods and classes is clear and relevant. The task of discovering causes, making donations, and tracking contributions is correctly assigned to the "User" class. The "CharityOrganizer" class correctly includes methods for managing campaigns and donor relationships. The simplicity of the diagram is good, and the types of attributes used are appropriate. However, the "Cause" and "Campaign" classes have redundant methods for creating, editing, and deleting, which could be simplified.

User3: 6/10
The student has identified some of the main classes, but some important classes like "Donation" and "Campaign" are missing. The naming of methods and classes is clear and relevant. The types of attributes used are appropriate. However, the diagram is a bit complex with the inclusion of the "UserSupportsCause" class, which could be represented as a relationship between "User" and "Cause". The class "DonorRelationship" is not connected to any other class, which is a mistake.

User4: 9/10
The student has correctly identified the main classes and their relationships. The naming of methods and classes is clear and relevant. The task of discovering causes, making donations, and tracking contributions is correctly assigned to the "User" class. The "Organizer" class correctly includes methods for managing campaigns and relationships. The simplicity of the diagram is good, and the types of attributes used are appropriate. However, the student has divided the UML into multiple diagrams, which might make it harder to understand the overall system.
