User1: Score = 8/10
The diagram is quite simple and easy to understand. The naming of methods and classes is clear and directly related to the task. The relationships between classes are also correctly used. However, there are no attribute types mentioned, which reduces the score slightly.

User2: Score = 7/10
The diagram is simple and the naming of methods and classes is good. However, the attribute types are not used consistently. For example, the price is a Double in the InGameItem class, but it would be better as an integer or float. The relationships between classes are correctly used, but the direction of the relationship could be better defined.

User3: Score = 9/10
The diagrams are divided into different files, which makes it easier to understand each class separately. The naming of methods and classes is clear and directly related to the task. The attribute types are used correctly and consistently. The relationships between classes are not shown, which makes it a bit harder to understand the overall system. However, the overall quality of the diagrams is very good.
