User1: Grade 8.5
The diagram is simple and easy to understand. The class names and methods are well named and reflect the task correctly. The relationships between classes are also correctly used. However, the attributes of the classes are missing, which is a significant part of the class diagram.

User2: Grade 7.5
The class diagram is split into multiple diagrams, which makes it a bit harder to understand the relationships between all classes. The classes and methods are well named, and the attributes are well defined. However, the relationships between the classes are missing, which is a significant part of the class diagram.

User3: Grade 9
The diagram is simple and easy to understand. The class names and methods are well named and reflect the task correctly. The relationships between classes are also correctly used. The attributes of the classes are present, but the types of the attributes are missing, which is a minor part of the class diagram.

User4: Grade 6
The diagram is a bit complex with extra classes that don't seem to be necessary for the task, like Player, GamerPurchasesItem, ManagesGame, UserBehavior, and CommunityEngagement. The relationships between classes are correctly used. However, the methods are missing in all classes, which is a significant part of the class diagram. The attributes are present in some classes, but missing in others.
