The student has done a good job in breaking down the classes and their relationships. The methods and attributes are named appropriately. However, the student has not shown the relationship between the PetOwner and ServiceProvider classes, and there is no class for Pet. Also, the student has created separate diagrams for each class and their relationships, which makes it harder to understand the overall system. 

User2: 8/10
The student has done a good job in creating a single diagram that shows all the classes and their relationships. The methods and attributes are named appropriately. However, the student has not included a class for Pet and there is no method for the ServiceProvider to interact with customers. Also, the student has not used types for the attributes.

User3: 6/10
The student has created a simple diagram with appropriate class names. However, the student has not included any attributes for the PetOwner and ServiceProvider classes, and there is no class for Pet and Schedule. Also, the student has not shown the relationship between the PetOwner and ServiceProvider classes. The methods are not named appropriately, for example, the ServiceProvider class should have methods like addService() and removeService() instead of interactWithCustomers().
