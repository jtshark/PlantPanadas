User1: 6/10
This user has a good understanding of the classes needed for the system but the diagrams are separated which makes it harder to understand the relationships between classes. The attributes and methods in the classes are well thought out but there are some missing methods such as setting prices for the ServiceProvider class. The relationships between classes are correctly used but are scattered across different diagrams.

User2: 4/10
This user has a simple diagram with the main classes but lacks attributes in the classes. The methods in the PetOwner and ServiceProvider classes are not specific and there are no methods in the Service class. The relationships between classes are correctly used but the diagram lacks detail and does not fully meet the original task.

User3: 9/10
This user has a detailed and complete diagram with all the necessary classes, attributes, and methods. The classes are well thought out and the relationships between them are correctly used. The diagram is a bit complex but it fully meets the original task. The naming of methods, classes, and attributes is good.
