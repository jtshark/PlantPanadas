User1: 8/10
The UML diagram provided by User1 is quite comprehensive and covers all the necessary classes and their relationships. The attributes and methods in each class are relevant and well-thought-out. However, there is no class for handling payments. Adding a Payment class with attributes like paymentId, userId, orderId, amount, and methods like makePayment(), refundPayment() would have made the design more complete.

User2: 9/10
User2's UML diagram is well-structured and includes all the necessary classes. The attributes and methods in each class are relevant and cover all the functionalities mentioned in the question. The use of multiplicity in the relationships between classes is also commendable. However, like User1, User2 also missed out on including a Payment class.

User3: 6/10
User3's UML diagrams are split across multiple files, which makes it a bit harder to understand the overall system design. The classes have relevant attributes and methods, but the relationships between them are not defined. Also, the Backend class seems redundant as its functionalities are already covered by the Administrator class. Furthermore, the Payment class is not linked to any other class, which is a significant oversight.
