User1: 7/10
User1's diagram is simple and easy to understand. The naming of methods and classes is clear and relevant. However, the diagram lacks some details. For instance, there are no attributes for the User and Meteorologist classes, which would have been useful to understand what data these classes hold. The relationships between classes are correctly used, but the diagram could have included more classes like Alerts and ViewingPreferences to fully represent the original task.

User2: 9/10
User2's diagram is detailed and comprehensive. The classes and methods are well-named and relevant to the original task. The use of attributes is excellent, providing a clear understanding of what data each class holds. The relationships between classes are correctly used and well-represented. The diagram also includes all necessary classes to represent the original task. However, the diagram could be simplified a bit, as it might be overwhelming for some to understand.

User3: 6/10
User3's diagrams are broken down into separate files, which could make it more difficult to understand the overall system. The naming of methods and classes is clear and relevant. However, the diagrams lack some details. For instance, there are no attributes for the Alerts, ForecastModel, GlobalWeather, Inquiry, and LocalWeather classes. The relationships between classes are correctly used in the diagrams where they are present. However, the diagrams do not fully represent the original task, as they are missing some classes and relationships.
