User1: 6/10
The student has separated each class into different files, which is not a common practice in UML. The naming of methods and classes is good, but the relationships between classes are not clearly defined. The student did not include attributes for all classes, which is a requirement of the task. The student did not include any relationships between the classes, which is a major part of UML diagrams.

User2: 9/10
The student has correctly identified all the necessary classes, attributes, and methods. The relationships between classes are also well defined. The naming of methods and classes is clear and descriptive. The student has included all necessary classes and has correctly related them. The only thing missing is the relationship between the User and the WeatherData class, which was a requirement of the task.

User3: 7/10
The student has identified most of the necessary classes, attributes, and methods. The relationships between classes are not completely correct. For instance, the relationship between the User and the WeatherData class is missing. The naming of methods and classes is clear and descriptive. The diagram is simple, but the student could have included more relationships between classes.

User4: 8/10
The student has identified all the necessary classes, attributes, and methods. The relationships between classes are well defined. The naming of methods and classes is clear and descriptive. The diagram is simple and easy to understand. However, the student could have included more attributes for the classes, such as the user's location or the meteorologist's name.
