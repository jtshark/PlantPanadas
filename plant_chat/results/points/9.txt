User1: 8/10
User1 has a good understanding of UML diagrams and has made an effort to separate each class into its own diagram. However, they have not shown any relationships between the classes which is a crucial part of UML diagrams. The classes themselves are well defined with appropriate methods.

User2: 10/10
User2's UML diagram is excellent. They have defined all the classes with appropriate attributes and methods. The relationships between the classes are also well defined. The diagram is comprehensive and covers all the requirements of the weather forecasting app.

User3: 7/10
User3's diagram is a bit simplistic. They have defined the classes and some methods but have not included any attributes in the classes. The relationships between the classes are shown but not labeled. The diagram does not fully cover the requirements of the weather forecasting app.
