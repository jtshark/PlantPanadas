### Request: We're developing a mobile app which lets users book and manage appointments with beauty experts, while professionals can update their schedule, manage payments, and see ratings and reviews from customers.
### Expert 1: So, the first step in designing a UML class diagram for this mobile app would be to identify the main entities and actors involved. From what I understand, we have two main actors - the users and the beauty professionals. Does that sound right?
### Expert 2: Yes, that's correct. The users will primarily be interested in booking and managing appointments, while the beauty professionals will need features like updating their schedule, managing payments, and checking ratings and reviews.
### Expert 3: Agreed. We should also consider any additional functionalities that we might need. For example, we might want to implement notifications for both the users and beauty professionals to keep them updated about the status of their appointments.
### Expert 1: That's a good point. So, let's start with the users. We'll need a class to represent them. Based on the user's request, it seems that we will have multiple types of users - customers who want to book appointments, and beauty professionals who want to manage their schedule. How do you think we should handle this distinction?
### Expert 2: We could use inheritance to represent the two types of users. We'd have a base User class, and then subclass it into Customer and BeautyProfessional classes. This way, both types can inherit common attributes and methods from the User class.
### Expert 3: That makes sense. What about the attributes and methods for the User class? I'm assuming we will need some basic details like name, email, and password. Anything else we should consider?
### Expert 1: We should definitely include attributes like address, phone number, and maybe even a profile picture. Regarding methods, we might want to have login and logout methods, as well as methods to update profile information.
### Expert 2: Agreed. Now, let's focus on the Booking functionality. We need a way for users to create, modify, and manage appointments. Should we create a separate class for this?
### Expert 3: Yes, I think it would be better to have a separate Booking class. This class could include attributes like appointment date, start time, end time, and any additional details specified by the user.
### Expert 1: That sounds good. We should also think about how the bookings will be associated with the users and beauty professionals. One way to do this is by adding attributes for the customer and the assigned professional in the Booking class. These attributes could store the respective User IDs.
### Instructions: Step 1: Create three classes to represent the three types of users - User, Customer (subclass of User), and BeautyProfessional (subclass of User). 

Step 2: Define attributes for the User class, including name, email, password, address, phone number, and profile picture. 

Step 3: Add methods to the User class, such as login(), logout(), and updateProfileInfo(). 

Step 4: Create a Booking class to handle the booking functionality. Include attributes like appointment date, start time, end time, and any other relevant details specified by the user. 

Step 5: Add attributes for the customer and the assigned beauty professional in the Booking class to link them through User IDs. 

Step 6: Define methods in the Booking class to create, modify, and manage appointments. 

Step 7: Create a Review class with attributes like rating and comments. 

Step 8: Establish an association between the Review class and each User class to enable users' reviews on beauty professionals and vice versa.

Step 9: Develop a Payment class with attributes like amount, payment method, and status. 

Step 10: Establish an association between the Payment class and the User class to track payment transactions. 

Step 11: Connect the User class with the Booking class through an association to represent that a customer can have multiple bookings, and the beauty professional can have multiple assigned bookings. 

Step 12: Establish associations between the Customer class and the Review and Payment classes to enable customers' payment transactions and reviews. 

Step 13: Connect the BeautyProfessional class with the Review and Payment classes via associations to track their reviews and payments. 

Step 14: Finally, consider adding any additional functionalities like notifications, and refine the class diagram as necessary.
