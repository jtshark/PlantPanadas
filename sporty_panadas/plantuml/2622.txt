### Request: Our project is to design a messaging application that allows users to send and receive instant messages, make voice and video calls, and share multimedia files with their contacts.
### Expert 1: So we need to start designing a UML class diagram for the messaging application. Let's begin by identifying the main entities or classes involved. We obviously need a User class to represent the users of the application.

### Expert 2: Agreed. The User class will have attributes like username, password, and contact list to store the relevant information for each user. It should also have methods to send and receive messages.

### Expert 1: Good point. Since the User class will have a contact list, we also need an entity to represent each individual contact. Let's call it Contact. It can have attributes like contactName and phoneNumber. This way, users can add contacts by name and/or number.

### Expert 3: In addition to sending and receiving messages, we also need classes to handle voice and video calls, as well as file sharing. How about creating three separate classes: VoiceCall, VideoCall, and FileShare?

### Expert 2: That sounds logical. We can then have methods in each of these classes to initiate and end a call, or to initiate a file transfer. We'll also need to define attributes to store information specific to each type of communication, such as duration for calls or file size for file sharing.

### Expert 1: We should also represent the concept of a ChatGroup. Users may want to create groups and send messages to multiple contacts at once. The ChatGroup class can have attributes like groupName and memberList, as well as methods for adding and removing members.

### Expert 3: Great suggestion. And since both individual users and groups can be recipients of a message, we should create an abstract class called Recipient to serve as a base class for both User and ChatGroup.

### Expert 2: Good point. The Recipient class can have common attributes like a receiving message inbox and methods to handle message receipt. Both User and ChatGroup classes will inherit from this base class.

### Expert 1: We also need a class to represent instant messages. Let's call it Message. It will have attributes like sender, recipient, timestamp, and content. We can also have methods to send, receive, and display messages.

### Expert 3: Absolutely. In addition, should we include classes to handle multimedia files, like Image, Audio, and Video? This way, we can define specific attributes and methods for each type of file.

### Expert 2: Yes, that makes sense. We can include attributes like fileName, fileSize, and filePath, as well as methods to download and play the files. However, we can also consider using a more general File class and distinguishing file types using an attribute like fileType.

### Expert 1: That's a good point. Using a single File class with a fileType attribute allows easy extensibility in case new file types are introduced or modifications are needed. We can then have methods specific to each file type using conditional statements based on fileType.

### Expert 3: Agreed. I think this class structure provides a comprehensive foundation for our messaging application. However, before proceeding, is there anything regarding the design that is unclear or requires clarification?


### Instructions: 1. Create a User class with attributes: username (string), password (string), and contactList (List<Contact>).
2. Add methods to the User class: sendMessage(message: Message), receiveMessage(message: Message).
3. Create a Contact class with attributes: contactName (string) and phoneNumber (string).
4. Create a VoiceCall class with attributes: duration (int), caller (User), and receiver (Recipient).
5. Add methods to the VoiceCall class: initiateCall(user: User), endCall().
6. Create a VideoCall class with attributes: duration (int), caller (User), and receiver (Recipient).
7. Add methods to the VideoCall class: initiateCall(user: User), endCall().
8. Create a FileShare class with attributes: fileName (string), fileSize (long), filePath (string), sender (User), and receiver (Recipient).
9. Add methods to the FileShare class: initiateFileTransfer(user: User), downloadFile().
10. Create a ChatGroup class with attributes: groupName (string) and memberList (List<Contact>).
11. Add methods to the ChatGroup class: addMember(contact: Contact), removeMember(contact: Contact).
12. Create an abstract class called Recipient with attribute: messageInbox (List<Message>).
13. Create a User class that extends Recipient, inheriting the messageInbox attribute and methods.
14. Create a ChatGroup class that extends Recipient, inheriting the messageInbox attribute and methods.
15. Create a Message class with attributes: sender (User), recipient (Recipient), timestamp (datetime), and content (string).
16. Add methods to the Message class: sendMessage(), receiveMessage(), displayMessage().
17. Create a File class with attributes: fileName (string), fileSize (long), filePath (string), and fileType (FileTypes).
18. Create an enum called FileTypes with values for different types of files (e.g., image, audio, video).
19. Review the design for any necessary modifications or improvements before proceeding with implementation or further development.

Note: This class diagram design is a simple representation and can be enhanced further to include additional attributes, methods, and relationships based on specific requirements and functionalities of the messaging application.
