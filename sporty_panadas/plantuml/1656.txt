### Request: My project aims to create a website that sells handmade candles. Customers can browse through different types of candles, add products to a cart, and securely check out their orders. As an administrator, I can supervise order processing and manage the product inventory.
### Expert 1: So, we need to design a UML class diagram for this website that sells handmade candles. Where do we start?

### Expert 2: Well, let's start by identifying the main entities involved in this system. We have customers, products (candles), a shopping cart, an administrator, and orders. Does that cover everything?

### Expert 3: That seems like a good starting point. Let's go through each entity and see what attributes and methods they might have.

### Expert 1: Alright. Customers will probably have attributes like a username, password, first name, last name, email address, and perhaps a mailing address.

### Expert 2: Agreed. And since customers can add candles to their cart, we'll need a separate class for the shopping cart. I think it should have an attribute for storing the list of candles added to the cart.

### Expert 3: Absolutely. Now, moving on to the product side, we can have a class for the candles. It might have attributes like a unique ID, name, description, price, and maybe a discount.

### Expert 1: Good point. Rather than storing the discounted price separately, we can just have a discount attribute and calculate the discounted price when needed using a getDiscountedPrice method.

### Expert 2: That makes sense. Customers will also need to be able to check out their orders. So, we should have another class for orders, which could have attributes like order date, total price, and the list of products included in the order.

### Expert 3: Exactly. And as an administrator, we also need a class to manage the product inventory. This class could have methods like addProduct and removeProduct to maintain stock levels.

### Expert 1: Agreed. It would also be helpful if the administrator could view the orders. So, we could have a method like getOrderList to get a list of all the orders made.

### Expert 2: That sounds complete to me. So, our UML class diagram would have classes for Customer, ShoppingCart, Candle, Order, and Inventory, with their respective attributes and methods.

### Expert 3: In addition, we should consider the relationships between these classes. For example, a customer can have a shopping cart, which means there is an association between the Customer and ShoppingCart classes.

### Expert 1: Good catch. We also need associations between Customer and Order, since a customer can have multiple orders, and between Customer and Candle, since a customer can add candles to their cart.

### Expert 2: Agreed. And the order class needs an association with both the Customer class and the Candle class, as it represents a specific order by a specific customer.

### Expert 3: Right. Finally, the administrator class has associations with both the Inventory class, for managing product stock, and with the Order class, for overseeing order processing.

### Expert 1: That wraps it up nicely. Now, we have a solid starting point for our UML class diagram and can begin further analysis and design based on this structure.

### Expert 2: Indeed. We might need more clarity on the requirements for certain attributes and methods, but overall, this should provide a good foundation for the website selling handmade candles. Is there anything we're missing?

(There is a pause as the experts collectively brainstorm)

### Expert 3: One thing that comes to mind is whether the administrator has any interaction with the shopping cart. For example, can they modify or monitor the contents of a customer's shopping cart, or is that left solely for the customer?

### Expert 1: That's a valid point. It would be wise to clarify this with the user before finalizing the class diagram.

### Expert 2: Agreed.
### Instructions: Solution:

1. Create a new class called "Customer" with attributes:
   - username: String
   - password: String
   - firstName: String
   - lastName: String
   - emailAddress: String
   - mailingAddress: String

2. Create a new class called "ShoppingCart" which stores the list of candles added by the customer. Include the following attribute:
   - candleList: List of Candle objects

3. Create a new class called "Candle" with attributes:
   - ID: int (unique identifier)
   - name: String
   - description: String
   - price: double
   - discount: double

   Include the following methods:
   - getDiscountedPrice(): double

4. Create a new class called "Order" with attributes:
   - orderDate: Date
   - totalPrice: double
   - productList: List of Candle objects

   Include the following associations:
   - Many-to-one association with Customer class
   - Many-to-many association with Candle class

5. Create a new class called "Administrator" with no additional attributes.

   Include the following associations:
   - One-to-one association with Inventory

6. Create a new class called "Inventory" with no additional attributes.

   Include the following methods:
   - addProduct(product: Candle): void
   - removeProduct(product: Candle): void

7. Define the associations between classes:
   - Customer (1) - (1) ShoppingCart
   - Customer (1) - (*) Order
   - Customer (1) - (*) Candle
   - Order (1) - (*) Candle
   - Administrator (1) - (1) Inventory

That completes the UML class diagram for the website selling handmade candles. From here, you can further develop the application based on these class definitions and associations.

### PlantUML:
Filename: handmade_candles_website.puml@startuml

class Customer {
  - username: String
  - password: String
  - firstName: String
  - lastName: String
  - emailAddress: String
  - mailingAddress: String
}

class ShoppingCart {
  - candleList: List<Candle>
}

class Candle {
  - ID: int
  - name: String
  - description: String
  - price: double
  - discount: double
  + getDiscountedPrice(): double
}

class Order {
  - orderDate: Date
  - totalPrice: double
  - productList: List<Candle>
}

class Administrator {
}

class Inventory {
  + addProduct(product: Candle): void
  + removeProduct(product: Candle): void
}

Customer -- ShoppingCart
Customer "1" -- "1..*" Order
Customer "1" -- "*" Candle
Candle "1" -- "*" Order
Administrator "1" -- "1" Inventory
