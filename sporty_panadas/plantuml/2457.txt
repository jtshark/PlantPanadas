### Request: My project is to develop a mobile application that helps users keep track of their daily water intake. The app should allow users to input how much water they drink throughout the day, provide notifications to remind them to drink water, and display their daily water consumption in simple graphs.
### Expert 1: So it seems like we need to design a UML class diagram for a mobile application that tracks water consumption. Are we all on the same page here?

### Expert 2: Yes, that's what we have to work on. Let's start by identifying the main entities in this system. We definitely need a User class to keep track of individual users. 

### Expert 3: Agreed. Each User would then have a method to input their daily water intake. Should we include a separate Water Intake class for this?

### Expert 1: Including a separate Water Intake class might be a good idea. We can have a User-Water_Intake relationship to represent the fact that a User can have multiple instances of Water Intake.

### Expert 2: Right. Additionally, since the app needs to notify users to drink water, we could have a Notification class. The User class can then have a notifications attribute which stores instances of the Notification class.

### Expert 3: That makes sense. We can then specify methods in the User class to add and remove notifications.
 
### Expert 1: True. Now, let's address the part about displaying daily water consumption in graphs. To do this, we could introduce a Consumption class that represents the daily water consumption for a User. The User class can have multiple instances of the Consumption class to track daily water consumption.

### Expert 2: I think we should also consider storing additional information about each Consumption, such as the date it applies to. This way, we can generate the graphs accurately.

### Expert 3: Absolutely, we can add a date attribute to the Consumption class for this purpose. And in addition to being able to add new Consumptions, we can include a method in the User class to calculate and provide the total daily consumption.

### Expert 1: That sounds great! We've covered most of the requirements, but do we have any further questions that we might need to ask the user for clarification on?

### Expert 2: Yes, I have one concern. Should we consider including an attribute in the User class to store the target daily water intake value? This way, the app can compare the user's consumption with their goal and provide notifications if they're behind.

### QUESTION: Shall we include an attribute in the User class to store the target daily water intake? 
### Answer:  Yes, that sounds like a great idea. We can include it in the User class as an attribute!
### Expert 1: Perfect! We will add an attribute in the User class to store the target daily water intake value. This will help the app compare the user's consumption with their goal and provide notifications accordingly.

### Expert 3: Great, it seems like we have a good understanding of the requirements now. We can go ahead and create a UML class diagram based on these findings.
### Instructions: Step 1: Create a new class diagram.
Step 2: Add the User class with the following attributes:
- name: String
- age: int
- targetDailyWaterIntake: float

Step 3: Add the Water_Intake class with the following attributes:
- intakeAmount: float
- time: Date

Step 4: Create an association between the User and Water_Intake classes with a 0..* multiplicity on the User side and a 1..* multiplicity on the Water_Intake side.

Step 5: Add the Notification class with the following attributes:
- message: String
- time: DateTime

Step 6: Create an association between the User and Notification classes with a 0..* multiplicity on the User side and a 1..* multiplicity on the Notification side.

Step 7: Add the Consumption class with the following attributes:
- amount: float
- date: Date

Step 8: Create an association between the User and Consumption classes with a 1..* multiplicity on the User side and a 1..* multiplicity on the Consumption side.

Step 9: Add the following methods to the User class:
- addWaterIntake(amount: float, time: Date): void
- removeWaterIntake(waterIntake: Water_Intake): void
- addNotification(message: String, time: DateTime): void
- removeNotification(notification: Notification): void
- calculateTotalDailyConsumption(): float

Step 10: Align the class diagram elements accordingly and add any necessary generalizations or aggregations based on the requirements.

That's it! This sequential solution outlines the steps needed to create a UML class diagram for the mobile application that tracks daily water intake.

### PlantUML:
Filename: water_intake_app.puml@startuml

class User {
- name: String
- age: int
- targetDailyWaterIntake: float

+ addWaterIntake(amount: float, time: Date): void
+ removeWaterIntake(waterIntake: Water_Intake): void
+ addNotification(message: String, time: DateTime): void
+ removeNotification(notification: Notification): void
+ calculateTotalDailyConsumption(): float
}

class Water_Intake {
- intakeAmount: float
- time: Date
}


class Notification {
- message: String
- time: DateTime
}

class Consumption {
- amount: float
- date: Date
}

User --> "0..*" Water_Intake
User --> "0..*" Notification
User --> "1..*" Consumption
