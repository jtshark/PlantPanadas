### Request: We need an UML model for our project that will help us visualize and plan the functionalities of our new social media app. This app will allow users to create a profile, connect with friends and share their photos, videos and messages on their personal feed.
### Expert 1: Alright, let's start by identifying the main components of the system. I suggest we begin with the User class since it forms the foundation of our app.

### Expert 2: That sounds good. We'll need attributes like name, username, email, and password to represent the user's basic information.

### Expert 3: Agreed. Additionally, we should consider including attributes for profile picture, about section, and perhaps a relationship status.

### Expert 1: Ah, good point. Let's also add methods like updateProfile(), changePassword(), and deleteUser() to support various user actions.

### Expert 2: Right. Now, to connect with friends, we could create a Friend class and establish a relationship between it and the User class using an association.

### Expert 3: Do you think we should also add a method to add or remove friends?

### Expert 1: Absolutely. We can include addFriend() and removeFriend() methods within the User class to enable users to manage their friendships.

### Expert 2: Makes sense. Now for sharing functionality, we'll need a class specifically for that. Let's call it Feed.

### Expert 3: Agreed. The Feed class could have attributes like post and media to store shared content.

### Expert 1: I would also consider adding an attribute for post date to sort the posts chronologically.

### Expert 2: That's a good suggestion. We could use a List<Feed> attribute within the User class to store their posts, updates, and shares.

### Expert 3: Additionally, we could allow users to delete or edit their posts by adding corresponding methods in the User class, like deletePost() and editPost().

### Expert 1: Great. Now, let's address how photos, videos, and messages will be represented. We could create separate classes for each, called Photo, Video, and Message, each of which would be associated with the Feed class.

### Expert 2: That sounds reasonable. To give them all a common ground, we can introduce an abstract class, let's say Media, from which Photo and Video will inherit.

### Expert 3: Oh, yes. Maybe we should include attributes like caption, tags, and likes in the Media class as well. And don't forget about the Message class. We'll need attributes for sender, receiver, and content.

### Expert 1: Agreed. Now, regarding likes, do you think we should create a separate class or simply add a likes attribute to the Feed class?

### Expert 2: I think it would be more suitable to add a List<User> attribute in the Feed class to keep track of users who have liked a post.

### Expert 3: I see your point. And instead of physically storing each user's personal photos, videos, and messages within their respective classes, we could save the URLs or file paths for access optimization. What do you both think?

### Expert 1: That's a great idea. It would help with storage efficiency, especially for larger media files.

### Expert 2: Absolutely. And it would also simplify the modeling process as we wouldn't need to introduce any additional complexities within the class structure.

### Expert 3: Fantastic. I think we have covered the primary functionalities of our social media app. Shall we move forward with our design and create relationships between these classes to complete the UML diagram?
### Instructions: Step 1: Create User class with attributes:
- name: String
- username: String
- email: String 
- password: String
- profilePicture: String
- about: String
- relationshipStatus: String

Step 2: Add methods to User class:
- updateProfile()
- changePassword()
- deleteUser()
- addFriend(user: User)
- removeFriend(user: User)
- createPost(feed: Feed)
- deletePost(feed: Feed)
- editPost(feed: Feed)

Step 3: Create class: Friend

Step 4: Establish an association between User and Friend classes.

Step 5: Create class: Feed with attributes:
- post: String
- media: List<Media>
- postDate: Date

Step 6: Add method to Feed class:
- deleteMedia(media: Media)

Step 7: Introduce an abstract class: Media class with attributes:
- caption: String
- tags: List<String>
- likes: List<User>

Step 8: Create Photo class extending Media class with attributes:
- photoUrl: String

Step 9: Create Video class extending Media class with attributes:
- videoUrl: String

Step 10: Create Message class with attributes:
- sender: User
- receiver: User
- content: String

Step 11: Create association between User and Feed classes representing the relationship of sharing content.

Step 12: Create association between Photo, Video, and Message classes with the Feed class.

Step 13: Create association between User and Photo class representing user's personal photos.

Step 14: Create association between User and Video class representing user's personal videos.

Step 15: Create association between User and Message class representing user's personal messages.

### PlantUML:
Filename: social_media_app.puml@startuml
class User {
- name: String
- username: String
- email: String
- password: String
- profilePicture: String
- about: String
- relationshipStatus: String
...    
+ updateProfile()
+ changePassword()
+ deleteUser()
+ addFriend(user: User)
+ removeFriend(user: User)
+ createPost(feed: Feed)
+ deletePost(feed: Feed)
+ editPost(feed: Feed)
}

class Friend {
}

User "1" -- "0..*" Friend

class Feed {
- post: String
- media: List<Media>
- postDate: Date
...
+ deleteMedia(media: Media)
}

User "1" *-- "0..*" Feed

abstract class Media {
- caption: String
- tags: List<String>
- likes: List<User>
...
}

class Photo {
- photoUrl: String
...
}

class Video {
- videoUrl: String
...
}

Photo --|> Media
Video --|> Media

class Message {
- sender: User
- receiver: User
- content: String
...
}

Message "1" -- "1" User
User "1" *-- "0..*" Media
