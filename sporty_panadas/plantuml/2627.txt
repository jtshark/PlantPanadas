### Request: Our project aims to develop a mobile application where registered users can book and purchase tickets for events such as movies, concerts, and sports, while the application admin can manage events and track sales records.
### Expert 1: So, we are tasked with designing a UML class diagram for a mobile application that allows users to book and purchase tickets for various events. Additionally, there needs to be functionality for an admin to manage events and track sales records. Is that correct?

### Expert 2: That's right. We'll need to identify the main classes that will be part of our system and determine their relationships and attributes.

### Expert 3: Let's start with the user's side first. We'll need a User class with attributes such as name, email, and password. We'll also need methods for login and logout. Additionally, I think we should include a UserRole attribute to distinguish between regular users and administrators.

### Expert 1: Great, that sounds like a good start. For the events, we could create an Event class with attributes like title, date, time, venue, and ticket price. We might also want to consider adding attributes like maximum capacity and remaining tickets to keep track of availability.

### Expert 2: Makes sense. And to handle the actual bookings, we can create a Booking class with attributes like bookingID, userID, eventID, and quantity. This will allow us to associate a booking with a specific user and event. We should also include a payment status attribute to keep track of whether the booking has been paid for or not.

### Expert 3: That's a good idea. Additionally, we should consider having a separate SalesRecord class to keep track of all the completed bookings. It could include attributes like bookingID, eventID, salesDate, and amount. This way, the admin can easily track and analyze sales data.

### Expert 1: Agreed. Now, let's think about the admin side. We'll need an Admin class with methods to add, edit, and delete events. We may also need a method to track the total number of tickets sold.

### Expert 2: I think we should also include an EventCategory class. Each event can belong to a specific category, such as movies, concerts, or sports. This would allow for better organization and filtering options for both the admin and users.

### Expert 3: That's a great idea. We can include attributes in the Event class to associate it with an EventCategory. This way, the admin can easily manage events within different categories.

### Expert 1: Agreed. Overall, our class diagram so far should include classes like User, Admin, Event, EventCategory, Booking, and SalesRecord. Are there any other classes we need to consider?

### Expert 2: It looks like we have covered most of the requirements. However, I have a suggestion. Instead of directly storing the age of the user, we could include their date of birth and have a method getAge in the User class. This way, the age will always be up-to-date and there won't be any need to update it every year.

### Expert 3: I completely agree. Storing the date of birth is a much more logical choice, especially considering the tendency people have to change their ages frequently. And having a getAge method ensures that we always have the correct age for any necessary calculations or validations.

### Expert 1: That makes sense. It's always a good practice to store data in a way that is less prone to becoming stale. Anything else we need to finalize in our class diagram?

### Expert 2: Instead of saving a price and a discounted price for an event, we could consider incorporating a discount attribute in the Event class. Along with a method like getDiscountedPrice, this will provide more flexibility if there are different types of discounts or if discounts can be applied in various scenarios.

### Expert 1: Absolutely, that's a great suggestion. Storing a discount attribute with a getDiscountedPrice method allows for easier calculation of the final price based on different discount scenarios. It avoids duplication and makes the code more maintainable.

### Expert 3: I agree. It would be much cleaner to have a single price attribute and calculate the discounted price dynamically. This way, we have more control over how discounts are applied and we avoid storing redundant data.

### Expert 1: I think we have covered all the necessary details for our UML class diagram based on the user request. We'll have classes like User, Admin, Event, EventCategory, Booking, and SalesRecord, along with their respective attributes and methods. Shall we proceed with creating the diagram?

### Expert 2: Yes, let's start working on the actual diagram and make any necessary adjustments according to the design principles and concrete examples we discussed.

### Expert 3: I'm excited about this project. With a well-designed and thought-out class diagram, we can create a robust mobile application that effectively meets the user's requirements.
### Instructions: 1. Create a User class with attributes such as name, email, and password.
2. Add attributes to the User class for user ID, date of birth, and UserRole (to distinguish between regular users and administrators).
3. Add methods to the User class for login and logout.
4. Create an EventCategory class.
5. Add attributes to the EventCategory class for category ID and name.
6. Create an Event class with attributes such as title, date, time, venue, and ticket price.
7. Add attributes to the Event class for event ID, maximum capacity, remaining tickets, and discounted price.
8. Add an association from the Event class to the EventCategory class.
9. Create a Booking class with attributes such as bookingID, userID, eventID, quantity, and payment status.
10. Create a SalesRecord class with attributes such as bookingID, eventID, salesDate, and amount.
11. Create an Admin class with methods for adding, editing, and deleting events.
12. Add a method to the Admin class for tracking the total number of tickets sold.
13. Add a method to the User class for calculating age based on date of birth.
14. Update the Event class to include a discount attribute.
15. Add a method to the Event class for calculating the discounted price based on the discount attribute.
16. Define the associations between classes (e.g., User has a Booking, Event has many Bookings, Admin manages Event, etc.).
17. Review the class diagram for completeness and accuracy.
