### Request: Our project is a system for automating the workflow associated with processing new client orders, including tracking order status, processing invoices, and generating business reports.
### Expert 1: So, our task is to design a UML class diagram for a system that handles processing new client orders, order tracking, invoice processing, and generating business reports. This sounds interesting! Let's start by identifying all the major functions our system needs to perform.

### Expert 2: Absolutely! From what I understand, we need to handle creating and managing new client orders, keeping track of the order status, generating and processing invoices, and finally generating various business reports. Did I miss anything?
### Instructions: Step 1: Identify the major entities/classes involved in the system:
- Client
- Order
- Invoice
- Business Report

Step 2: Create the respective classes:
- Create a class named "Client" with attributes such as clientID, name, address, contact details, etc.
- Create a class named "Order" with attributes like orderID, order date, status, clientID, and order items.
- Create a class named "Invoice" with attributes including invoiceID, invoice date, total amount, clientID, and orderID.
- Create a class named "BusinessReport" with attributes like reportID, report date, and any relevant report details.

Step 3: Define associations between classes:
- Create a one-to-many association between "Client" and "Order," as a client can have multiple orders.
- Establish a one-to-one association between "Order" and "Invoice," as one invoice is generated for each order.
- Add a one-to-many association between "Client" and "Invoice," as a client may have multiple invoices over time.
- Create a one-to-many association between "Client" and "BusinessReport," as clients may have multiple business reports generated for them.

Step 4: Add additional attributes and methods, as necessary:
- In the "Order" class, consider adding methods to track the order status, update status, and retrieve order items.
- Similarly, in the "Invoice" class, add methods for managing invoice status, processing payment, and calculating the total amount.
- In the "BusinessReport" class, include methods for generating various business reports based on specific criteria.

Step 5: Add other necessary classes (if any) to complete the automation system, such as:
- Class "OrderItem," to represent each item within an order, with attributes like itemID, description, quantity, price, etc.
- Class "OrderStatus," to define the status options for an order, with attributes like statusID and description.

Step 6: Define associations for the additional classes:
- Create a one-to-many association between "Order" and "OrderItem," as a single order can have multiple order items.
- Add a one-to-many association between "Order" and "OrderStatus," as an order can have multiple status changes over time.

Continue refining the diagram by arranging the classes neatly, indicating aggregations or compositions (if applicable), and considering inheritance, polymorphism, or other desired relationships between classes.

    - address: string
    - contactDetails: string

    - clientID: integer
    + getOrderItems(): list<OrderItem>

    - invoiceID: integer
    - invoiceDate: date
    - totalAmount: decimal
    - clientID: integer
    - orderID: integer

}

class BusinessReport {
    - reportID: integer
    - reportDate: date
    - reportDetails: string
    - clientID: integer
}

class OrderItem {
    - itemID: integer
    - description: string
    - quantity: integer
    - price: decimal
}

class OrderStatus {
    - statusID: integer
    - description: string
}

Client "1" --> "0..*" Order
Order "1" -right- "1" Invoice
Client "1" --> "0..*" Invoice
Client "1" --> "0..*" BusinessReport
Order "1" --> "1..*" OrderItem
Order -- OrderStatus
