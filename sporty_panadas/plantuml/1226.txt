### Request: Our project is to create a mobile app that allows users to input and track their daily workouts, monitor their progress, set goals, and share their workouts with friends via social media. Additionally, the app should provide useful fitness information such as exercise tutorials and nutrition tips.
### Expert 1: So, the user wants a mobile app that helps track daily workouts, monitor progress, set goals, shared workouts, and provide fitness information. This seems to be a comprehensive fitness app.

### Expert 2: Yes, it definitely is. To start designing the class diagram, we should think about the core components of the app. We will need classes like User, Workout, Goal, FitnessInformation, and SocialMedia.

### Expert 3: Agreed. Let's dive deeper into each class and clarify their attributes and relationships. For the User class, we'll need attributes such as name, age, gender, and email. What other attributes would be useful?

### Expert 1: One important attribute in this case could be the date of birth instead of directly storing the age. By calculating the age based on the date of birth attribute, we can always have the most up-to-date information even as time passes.

### Expert 3: That makes sense. We will possibly need a method in the User class called getAge(), which calculates the age based on the date of birth. It helps maintain accurate and dynamic age calculations without the need for users to update their age manually.

### Expert 2: Good point. Now let's move on to the Workout class. I'm thinking it should have attributes like workoutType, startDateTime, and duration. Additionally, we could have an attribute to track the calories burned during the workout.

### Expert 1: Agreed. Having attributes for type, start time, and duration would allow users to input specific details about each workout.

### Expert 3: Yes, and for calories burned, we can also add a method called calculateCaloriesBurned(), which can perform the necessary calculations based on factors like workout type and duration. This way, caloric information stays consistent and avoids the risk of manual errors.

### Expert 2: Great idea. Now, what about the class for goals? I'm thinking of including attributes like goalType (weight loss, muscle gain, etc.), targetValue (target weight, weight to lift, etc.), and completionStatus.

### Expert 3: Sounds good. However, instead of directly saving the progress towards the goals, we could add a method called trackProgress(). This method can calculate and dynamically update the progress based on other factors, such as workout history or measurements. By doing so, any change in those factors can automatically update the completion status and provide accurate progress tracking without requiring manual updates.

### Expert 1: Excellent suggestion. Now let's discuss the FitnessInformation class. This class could have attributes like exerciseTutorialUrl and nutritionTip.

### Expert 2: Sounds good. With those attributes, users can access detailed exercise tutorials and nutrition tips for additional guidance and information.

### Expert 3: Agreed. We should determine if the relationships between these classes require further clarification. I think the User class needs a relationship to both Workout and Goal classes since these are personalized for each user. Additionally, there could be an association between the User class and the SocialMedia class for sharing workouts.

### Expert 1: Good point. It seems like both Workout and Goal should have a many-to-one relationship with the User class as each user can have multiple workouts and set multiple goals. And yes, there would be a many-to-one relationship between the User and SocialMedia classes as well since multiple users can use social media to share their workouts.

### Expert 2: This makes sense. We've covered the core components so far. Now we should consider the methods and associations needed to fulfill the requirements of the app for an effective class diagram.

### Expert 3: Absolutely. Making use of additional methods adds value to the class diagram and helps in the app's functionality and longevity. Let's continue refining the diagram with further discussions.

### Instructions: Step-by-Step Solution:

1. Create a User class with the following attributes: name, email, and dateOfBirth.
   - Add the getAge() method to calculate the age dynamically based on the dateOfBirth attribute.

2. Create a Workout class with the following attributes: workoutType, startDateTime, duration, and caloriesBurned.

3. Create a Goal class with the following attributes: goalType, targetValue, and completionStatus.
   - Add the trackProgress() method to dynamically calculate and update the progress based on other factors.

4. Create a FitnessInformation class with the following attributes: exerciseTutorialUrl and nutritionTip.

5. Create a SocialMedia class (optional) to handle sharing workouts through social media platforms.

6. Define associations between classes:
   - User has a many-to-one association with both Workout and Goal classes.
   - User has a many-to-one association with the SocialMedia class for sharing workouts.
   - FitnessInformation can be utilized by the User class for informative purposes.

Note: It's important to remember that a class diagram is only one aspect of designing the overall system. The solution above solely focuses on creating a clear class diagram based on the requirements given.

### PlantUML:
Filename: fitness_app.puml
@startuml

class User {
  - name: String
  - email: String
  - dateOfBirth: Date
  + getAge(): int
}

class Workout {
  - workoutType: String
  - startDateTime: DateTime
  - duration: TimeSpan
  - caloriesBurned: double
}

class Goal {
  - goalType: String
  - targetValue: double
  - completionStatus: bool
  + trackProgress(): void
}

class FitnessInformation {
  - exerciseTutorialUrl: String
  - nutritionTip: String
}

class SocialMedia {
  
}

User --> Workout
User --> Goal
User --> SocialMedia
SocialMedia --- Workout
FitnessInformation --> User
