### Request: Our project is a bakery website, where customers can view products and place orders, while the bakery owner manages orders and sends out deliveries.
### Expert 1: So, for this bakery website project, we need to design a UML class diagram. Let's start by identifying the main entities. I think we'll need a "Product" class to represent the bakery items being sold. Any objections to that?

### Expert 2: No objections here. A "Product" class sounds like a great starting point. We can include attributes like name, description, price, and maybe even an image URL.

### Expert 3: Agreed, including the image URL would be convenient for customers to see what the product looks like. We should also consider having a separate class to represent the customer's order.

### Expert 1: I completely agree. We could have an "Order" class that may contain attributes like order ID, customer information, order date, and order status. Moreover, we can represent the association between "Order" and "Product" using a line connecting the two classes.

### Expert 2: Right, on the "Order" class, we can also include a method called "calculateTotalPrice" that sums up the prices of all the products in the order. Instead of saving the total price as an attribute, it's better to compute it on demand.

### Expert 3: Good point! By calculating the total price on demand, we ensure that any updates to the prices of individual products are correctly reflected in the overall price. Additionally, we could have a separate class for the bakery owner to manage orders.

### Expert 1: Absolutely. Let's call it the "Owner" class. In this class, we can include methods such as "receiveOrder" to handle an incoming order, "prepareOrder" to prepare the items for delivery, and "sendDelivery" to dispatch the ordered items.

### Expert 2: And we'll also need a connection between the "Owner" class and the "Order" class since the owner needs to manage and interact with individual orders. Maybe we can use a composition relationship, as an owner would retain ownership of the orders but order objects could exist even if there's no owner anymore.

### Expert 3: Agreed. And to ensure encapsulation, we can encapsulate the data members of the "Product" and "Order" classes by making them private and providing getter methods to access them. This way, external entities interact with these classes via their well-defined public interfaces.

### Expert 1: That makes sense. We should also consider including an "Address" class to represent the customer's delivery address since it's an important aspect of the ordering process.

### Expert 2: Definitely! The "Address" class could include attributes like street, city, state, and zip code. We can associate the "Address" class with the "Order" class to signify the delivery location.

### Expert 3: Just to clarify, when connecting the "Address" class with the "Order" class, it should be a unidirectional association, as the order needs the address for delivery, but the address doesn't need a reference to the order.

### Expert 1: Great point, clear that up for me. I think we're moving in the right direction. However, should we also consider including a class to represent the "User"?

### Expert 2: I believe it would be beneficial to have a "User" class. It can include attributes like username, password, and maybe even a profile picture URL. We can associate the "User" class with the "Order" class to represent who placed the order.

### Expert 3: Agreed. Additionally, having a separate "User" class allows for extending the functionality of the website later on, such as creating user profiles, managing preferences, and providing personalized recommendations.

### Expert 1: That all sounds logical. I think we have a good starting point for our UML class diagram based on the user requirements. Shall we begin drafting it?

### Expert 2: Definitely! Let's start by representing the "Product," "Order," "Owner," "Address," and "User" classes with their respective attributes and methods. We can then refine it by considering any relationships or additional entities that may be required.
### Instructions: 1. Create a "Product" class with attributes: name, description, price, and image URL.
2. Create an "Order" class with attributes: order ID, customer information, order date, and order status. Include a method called "calculateTotalPrice" to compute the total price of the order dynamically.
3. Establish a unidirectional association between the "Order" class and the "Product" class to represent products included in an order.
4. Create an "Owner" class with methods: "receiveOrder" to handle incoming orders, "prepareOrder" to prepare items for delivery, and "sendDelivery" to dispatch the ordered items.
5. Establish a composition relationship between the "Owner" class and the "Order" class, as the ownership of orders is retained by the owner and order objects can exist even if there's no owner reference.
6. Create an "Address" class with attributes: street, city, state, and zip code.
7. Establish a unidirectional association between the "Address" class and the "Order" class to represent the delivery location for an order.
8. Create a "User" class with attributes: username, password, and profile picture URL.
9. Establish a bidirectional association between the "User" class and the "Order" class to represent the user who placed the order. It should be possible to navigate from a user to their order(s), and vice versa.
10. Encapsulate private data members of the "Product" and "Order" classes and provide getter methods to access them.
11. Review the class diagram for any additional entities or relationships required based on the bakery website-specific requirements.
12. Refine the class diagram as needed and document all classes, attributes, methods, and associations.
13. Validate the class diagram against the system requirements and ensure its correctness.
14. Communicate the designed class diagram to the development team for implementation.

### PlantUML:
Filename: BakeryWebsite.puml@startuml

class Product {
  - name: String
  - description: String
  - price: double
  - imageURL: String
}

class Order {
  - orderID: String
  - customerInfo: String
  - orderDate: Date
  - orderStatus: String
  
  + calculateTotalPrice(): double
}

Order "1" -- "*" Product

class Owner {
  + receiveOrder(order: Order)
  + prepareOrder(order: Order)
  + sendDelivery(order: Order)
}

Owner "1" *-- "1..*" Order

class Address {
  - street: String
  - city: String
  - state: String
  - zipCode: String
}

Address "1" -- "*" Order

class User {
  - username: String
  - password: String
  - profilePictureURL: String
}

User "1" -- "*" Order
