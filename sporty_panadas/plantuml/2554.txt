### Request: Please design a mobile application that allows pet owners to book appointments, consult with veterinarians via video support, and receive prescriptions while veterinarians manage their schedules, pet records, and consultations.
### Expert 1: So, we need to design a class diagram for a mobile application that allows pet owners to book appointments, consult with veterinarians, and receive prescriptions, while veterinarians can manage their schedules, pet records, and consultations.

### Expert 2: Yes, that's correct. Let's first identify the main actors in this system. We have pet owners and veterinarians. Any other actors we need to consider?

### Expert 1: Well, we could also include the pets as actors, as they are an important part of the system and their information needs to be stored and managed.

### Expert 3: I agree with that. In addition to storing and managing pet records, we also need to handle appointment scheduling, video consultations, and prescription management. These should be separate classes, right?

### Expert 2: Yes, I think so. We could have a Pet class for storing pet information like name, species, age, and medical history. And then we can have an Appointment class to handle scheduling and a Prescription class for managing prescriptions.

### Expert 1: That sounds reasonable. How about the video consultation feature? Would that be a separate class as well?

### Expert 3: I think so. We can have a VideoConsultation class to handle video calls between pet owners and veterinarians. It can have attributes like start time, end time, and maybe a reference to the assigned veterinarian.

### Expert 2: And what about user management? Should we have separate classes for pet owners and veterinarians?

### Expert 1: Good point. Yes, we should have a User class to represent all types of users in the system and then have separate classes like PetOwner and Veterinarian that extend the User class with specific attributes and methods.

### Expert 3: Agreed. And the User class could include attributes like username, password, email, and maybe contact number for notifications and contact purposes.

### Expert 1: Makes sense. So, we have the Pet, User, Appointment, Prescription, and VideoConsultation classes. Anything else we need to consider?

### Expert 2: How about the VeterinarianSchedule? It could be a separate class to manage the schedules of veterinarians, with attributes like availability slots, booked appointments, and maybe their preferred consultation hours.

### Expert 3: That's a good addition. We'll also need to link these classes together with appropriate relationships. For example, an Appointment would be associated with Pet, User, and Veterinarian. Is there anything else missing?

### Expert 1: Actually, we might need to add a Payment class to handle transactions related to the prescription or appointment fees. This would be linked to the User and Prescription/Appointment classes.

### Expert 2: Good catch. And should we represent the prescriptions and medical history within the Pet class as separate attributes, or should we create separate Prescription/MedicalHistory classes?

### Expert 3: I think it would be better to have separate classes. That way, we can handle more detailed information, manage multiple prescriptions or medical records, and provide methods to access or update them easily.

### Expert 1: Agreed. So, to summarize, we'll have classes like Pet, User, Appointment, Veterinarian, VideoConsultation, Prescription, VeterinarianSchedule, and maybe Payment. In addition, we could have separate classes for MedicalHistory and notifications.

### Expert 2: That covers all the major functionalities required for the mobile application. Once we have the class diagram, we can proceed with defining attributes, methods, and associations. We'll need clarifications from the user for any additional details or specific requirements.

### Expert 3: Let's document this information and start designing the class diagram accordingly. We can seek clarification from the user if needed.
### Instructions: Step 1: Create a User class with attributes:
- username
- password
- email
- contactNumber

Step 2: Create a PetOwner subclass that extends User class with additional attributes if necessary.

Step 3: Create a Veterinarian subclass that extends User class with additional attributes like:
- specialization
- licenseNumber

Step 4: Create a Pet class with attributes:
- name
- species
- age
- medicalHistory

Step 5: Create an Appointment class with attributes:
- pet (association with Pet class)
- petOwner (association with PetOwner class)
- veterinarian (association with Veterinarian class)
- startTime
- endTime

Step 6: Create a VideoConsultation class with attributes:
- appointment (association with Appointment class)
- startTime
- endTime

Step 7: Create a Prescription class with attributes:
- pet (association with Pet class)
- veterinarian (association with Veterinarian class)
- medication
- dosage
- duration

Step 8: Create a VeterinarianSchedule class with attributes:
- veterinarian (association with Veterinarian class)
- availabilitySlots
- bookedAppointments

Step 9: Create a Payment class with attributes:
- user (association with User class)
- appointment (association with Appointment class)
- prescription (association with Prescription class)
- amount
- paymentMethod

Step 10: If necessary, create a MedicalHistory class with relevant attributes to store detailed pet health records, such as allergies, surgeries, vaccinations, etc.

Step 11: Create associations between classes as described in the discussion. Some associations may require multiplicity or dependency notations.

Step 12: Continue adding necessary attributes, methods, and associations based on any other specific requirements.

Please note that this step-by-step solution assumes that basic knowledge of creating class diagrams and their elements is already known to the person executing these steps.

Hint: Pay attention while seeding the code chunk. The first line 
should  contain \beginverbp[vrb]{SHELL}.
The last line of code should also be prefixed correctly among:
\vari{python,npy,c}, to ensure proper typevoiding.



After modifying and running the seed code collect your final accomplished uml classdiagram.
