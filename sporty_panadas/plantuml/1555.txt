### Request: Our project is for a travel booking website, where users can search for flights, select airplane seats, and make arrangements for transport to the airport.
### Expert 1: So we're designing a class diagram for a travel booking website. Let's start with the main classes. We'll definitely need a User class, Booking class, and Flight class. Any other ideas?

### Expert 2: I think we should also consider having a Seat class, to track details about the seats on the airplane. And maybe a Transport class to handle arrangements for transport to the airport.

### Expert 3: Agreed. In addition to these classes, we might also need a Payment class to handle payment details and a Search class to allow users to search for flights. The Payment class could be connected to the Booking class.

### Expert 1: Good point. We can also have a separate class called Airport to store information about different airports.

### Expert 2: That's a good idea. And maybe we can even have a class called Time to store time-related information such as departure time and arrival time in the Flight class.

### Expert 3: Makes sense. And speaking of time, do you think we should also track the date of birth of the users?

### Expert 1: Hmm, it depends. Storing the date of birth would allow us to calculate the user's age, but we could also include a method in the User class called getAge to calculate it dynamically.

### Expert 2: Agreed. It's generally best to store the date of birth itself rather than the age directly since age is variable and can change over time. We can always calculate the current age with a method.

### Expert 3: Okay, that makes sense. What about the price of the flights? Should we have attributes for both the original price and any discounts?

### Expert 1: Actually, I think it would be better to have a separate Discount class that stores information about the discount such as the percentage off. The Flight class can then reference the Discount class to calculate the final price.

### Expert 2: That's a good idea. It allows for more flexibility, especially if there are different types of discounts applied to flights.

### Expert 3: I agree. Having a Discount class would also allow for better organization and maintainability if we expand the website to include discounts on other types of services in the future.

### Expert 1: Alright, adding a Discount class is a good move. I'll make sure to include that in the class diagram.

### Expert 2: We're covering a lot of ground here. Is there anything else we should consider when designing this class diagram?

### Expert 3: One thing that comes to mind is whether we should handle flight ticket reservations separately from booking other services, such as airport transportation or hotel stays.

### Expert 1: Good point. It might be a good idea to have a different subclass for each type of reservation so that it's easier to manage and update them. For example, separate "FlightReservation," "TransportReservation," and "HotelReservation" classes.

### Expert 2: That would definitely make it easier to handle specific operations and updates for each kind of reservation. We can add those subclasses under the Booking class.

### Expert 3: Great suggestion. I'll make sure to include these subclasses in the class diagram as well.

### Expert 1: Excellent. I think this covers the basics of our class design for the travel booking website. Let's proceed with implementing the class diagram and continue refining it as needed.
### Instructions: Solution:

1. Start by creating the following classes in the UML diagram:

- User
- Booking
- Flight
- Seat
- Transport
- Payment
- Search
- Airport
- Time

2. Define the attributes for each class:

User:
- username: String
- password: String
- dateOfBirth: Date

Booking:
- bookingId: String
- user: User
- flight: Flight
- transport: Transport

Flight:
- flightNumber: String
- departureTime: Time
- arrivalTime: Time
- origin: Airport
- destination: Airport

Seat:
- seatNumber: String
- flight: Flight

Transport:
- transportProvider: String
- time: Time

Payment:
- amount: Double
- booking: Booking

Search:
- numberOfPassengers: int
- dateOfTravel: Date
- origin: Airport
- destination: Airport

Airport:
- airportCode: String
- city: String

Time:
- hour: int
- minute: int

3. Create associations between classes:

- Add associations between User and Booking (one-to-many).
- Add associations between Booking and Flight, Transport, payment class (one-to-one).
- Add associations between Flight and Airport (two associations).
- Add an association between Seat and Flight (one-to-one).

4. Additionally, while designing according to new suggestions, include subclassing for different types of reservations:

- Add subclasses FlightReservation, TransportReservation, and HotelReservation under Booking.

Note: The guided steps above reflect the agreed design from the experts' discussion. The implementation may vary based on specific requirements and frameworks.

### PlantUML:

class User {
- username: String

}

class Flight {
- flightNumber: String
- departureTime: Time
- arrivalTime: Time
- origin: Airport
- destination: Airport
}

class Seat {
- seatNumber: String
- flight: Flight
}

class Transport {
- transportProvider: String
- time: Time
}

class Payment {
- amount: Double
- booking: Booking
}

class Search {
- numberOfPassengers: int
- dateOfTravel: Date
- origin: Airport
- destination: Airport
}

class Airport {
- airportCode: String
- city: String
}

class Time {
- hour: int
- minute: int
}
