### Request: Our project is an online store where customers can browse and purchase products, while the staff manages the inventory and shipping processes.
### Expert 1: So, our user wants us to design a UML class diagram for an online store. We need to consider both the customer-facing features as well as the inventory and shipping management functionalities. Any initial thoughts?

### Expert 2: Yes, I think we should start by identifying the main actors in this system. We have the customers and the staff members. How about we create two separate classes for them?

### Expert 1: That sounds reasonable. So, for the customers, we could have attributes like name, email, and password to handle authentication. Additionally, we'll need methods for browsing products and making purchases. Any thoughts on these methods?

### Expert 3: We could also include an attribute to track the customer's order history, to provide them with a way to view their previous purchases easily.

### Expert 1: That's a good point. Let's include an attribute for order history. We can store this as a list of orders.

### Expert 2: And for the staff members, we'll need attributes like name and employee ID. They'll have additional methods to manage inventory and process orders. For example, searching products, updating stock levels, and handling shipping.

### Expert 3: Agreed. Adding those methods to the staff class makes sense.

### Expert 1: Just to clarify, when you mentioned updating stock levels, did you mean updating stock levels per product? So should we have a separate class for products?

### Expert 2: Yes, I think creating a Product class makes sense. It would have attributes like name, description, price, and stock level.

### Expert 3: And to help the customers, we can provide a method to display product details, right?

### Expert 1: Absolutely. We should also consider potential relationships between classes. For example, there could be an association between a customer class and a product class to represent a purchase.

### Expert 2: That's a good point. The customer class could have a method for adding products to their shopping cart, which associates those products with their account.

### Expert 3: Right. And when the customer is ready to make a purchase, they can invoke a method like "checkout" which creates an order object that represents the transaction.

### Expert 1: Exactly. And to manage inventory, the staff class could have a method to decrease the stock level of a product when it's purchased.

### Expert 2: I think we are off to a good start here. We should continue exploring more specific relationships and attributes within each class to cover all the required functionalities.

### Expert 3: Agreed. Let's document these initial ideas and discuss further considerations in our next meeting.
### Instructions: Solution:
1. Create a class called "Customer" with attributes: name, email, password, order history.
2. Create a class called "Staff" with attributes: name, employee ID.
3. Create a class called "Product" with attributes: name, description, price, stock level.
4. Add methods to the Customer class: browseProducts(), purchaseProduct(), displayOrderHistory().
5. Add methods to the Staff class: searchProducts(), updateStockLevel(), processOrder().
6. Create an association between the Customer and Product classes for a purchase.
7. Add a method to the Customer class: addToCart().
8. Create an association between the Customer and Staff classes for a customer service interaction.
9. Add a method to the Customer class: contactStaff().
10. Add an association between the Staff and Product classes for inventory management.
11. Add methods to the Staff class: updateProductDetails(), addProduct(), deleteProduct().
12. Create an Order class with attributes: orderID, date, totalAmount.
13. Create an association between the Customer and Order classes to represent an order creation.
14. Add a method to the Customer class: checkout() that creates a new Order object.
15. Add associations between the Staff and Order classes to represent order processing and shipping management.
16. Add methods to the Staff class: processOrder(), shipOrder().

### PlantUML:
Filename: online_store_class_diagram.puml

@startuml
class Customer {
  - name : String
  - email : String
  - password : String
  - orderHistory : List<Order>

  + browseProducts()
  + purchaseProduct()
  + displayOrderHistory()
  + addToCart()
  + contactStaff()
}
class Staff {
  - name : String
  - employeeID : String

  + searchProducts()
  + updateStockLevel()
  + processOrder()
  + updateProductDetails()
  + addProduct()
  + deleteProduct()
  + processOrder()
  + shipOrder()
}
class Product {
  - name : String
  - description : String
  - price : double
  - stockLevel : int

  + displayProductDetails()

}
class Order {
  - orderID : String
  - date : Date
  - totalAmount : double

}

Customer "1" --> "0..*" Product : purchases
Customer "1" <*> "1" Staff : customer service interaction
Staff "1" --> "0..*" Product : inventory management
Customer "1" --> "0..*" Order : creates
Staff "1" --> "0..*" Order : processes and ships
