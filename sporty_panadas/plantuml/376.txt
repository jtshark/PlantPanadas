### Request: Our project involves building a mobile application that allows users to note their daily tasks and set reminders for them, along with a feature to prioritize and organize the tasks into categories and view statistics of completed tasks.
### Expert 1: So it seems like we need to design a UML class diagram for a mobile application that manages tasks and provides reminders, prioritization, categorization, and statistics. 

### Expert 2: That's correct. First of all, we'll need a class to represent the tasks. I suggest we have attributes like task_id, title, description, start_date, due_date, and is_completed.

### Expert 3: I agree. Additionally, we should consider having a method to calculate the remaining time until the due date. This way, we can display the urgency of each task.

### Expert 1: Good point! It will be helpful to include that calculation. Also, to implement reminders for the tasks, should we introduce another class?

### Expert 2: Yes, we could create a separate Reminder class, with attributes like reminder_id, task_id (to identify which task it is related to), reminder_date, reminder_time, and a status to check if the reminder has been triggered.

### Expert 3: That sounds reasonable. And if we want to provide the feature to prioritize and organize the tasks into categories, we will need classes for that as well. How about creating a Category class?

### Expert 1: I think that would work nicely. The Category class could have attributes like a category_id, category_name, and maybe a color_code to visually distinguish the categories.

### Expert 2: Agreed. We will also need a connection between the Task class and Category class since a task can belong to multiple categories. We can achieve this by using an association relationship between them.

### Expert 3: As we progress further, we should also consider adding statistics functionality. For instance, we may want to keep track of completed tasks and generate reports based on completed tasks.

### Expert 1: Yes, let's add the ability to track completed tasks as an attribute in the Task class. We could also have methods in the Task class to handle statistics generation based on completed tasks count or completed tasks within a specified time period.

### Expert 2: That sounds sensible. Additionally, we might consider implementing a User class to manage user information, such as name, email, and password, along with authentication and authorization.

### Expert 3: True. Having a User class will provide better control and enhance the security aspect of the application. Also, I recommend adding a method to the User class to generate a graphical representation of task completion statistics for each user.

### Expert 1: Great suggestion! By encapsulating this functionality within the User class, we will have better separation of concerns. And it will simplify the creation of visual statistics when needed.

### Expert 2: Perfect. I think our initial design is shaping up well. Is there anything else we should consider or clarify from the user?

### Expert 3: Before we finalize the design, should we ask the user if the tasks need to have attributes such as estimated completion time or level of importance? These could be helpful in sorting tasks and optimizing the user's workload.

### Expert 1: Good point! Let's ask the user about the need for those attributes. We'll preface the question with "### QUESTION" to indicate that we are requesting clarification:

### QUESTION: Do the tasks need to have attributes like estimated completion time or level of importance? This will help us in optimizing the user's workload. 
### Answer: 
Yes, please include attributes like estimated completion time and level of importance. This would be very helpful in sorting tasks and organizing them. Thank you!
### Expert 2: Thank you for clarifying! We will definitely include attributes like estimated completion time and level of importance in our Task class. This will allow us to provide sorting and organizing options based on these factors. It will enhance the functionality and user experience of the application.

### Expert 3: Including these attributes will provide more flexibility to the users to prioritize their tasks based on their importance. It will also help them better manage their time and workload. This is a great addition to the design.

### Expert 1: I'm glad we asked for clarification. By incorporating the estimated completion time and level of importance attributes, we can develop features to sort and filter tasks effectively. Users will be able to easily identify and focus on high-priority tasks.

### Expert 2: Absolutely! These attribute additions will contribute to the overall efficiency and usefulness of the application. Is there anything else we should address or finalize with the user regarding the UML class diagram?

### Expert 3: It seems like we have achieved the objectives as requested. The addition of estimated completion time, level of importance, and incorporating all the classes discussed will enable us to provide the desired functionality. We can now proceed with finalizing the UML class diagram.

### Expert 1: I concur. With the confirmation of the user requirements and the feedback received, I believe we are ready to finalize the UML class diagram to represent the design of the mobile application. We should document these additions and ensure all the relationships and attributes are appropriately represented.

### Expert 2: That sounds like the next best step. After documenting the additions and dependencies, we can move forward with implementing the application. The UML class diagram will effectively guide us during the development process.

### Expert 3: Indeed! I appreciate all the discussions we had. Our UML class diagram will be crucial in ensuring a structured implementation while meeting the user's requirements effectively.

### Expert 1: Agreed! Thank you both for your valuable contributions. Let's proceed with documenting the finalized UML class diagram and initiating the development process.
### Instructions: 1. Create a Task class:
   - Add attributes: task_id, title, description, start_date, due_date, is_completed, estimated_completion_time, level_of_importance.
   - Add method: calculate_remaining_time()

2. Create a Reminder class:
   - Add attributes: reminder_id, task_id, reminder_date, reminder_time, status.

3. Create a Category class:
   - Add attributes: category_id, category_name, color_code.

4. Create an association between Task and Category classes to support multiple categories per task.

5. Create a User class:
   - Add attributes: user_id, name, email, password.
   - Include authentication and authorization methods.

6. Add a method in the User class to generate statistics graph based on completed tasks.

7. Finalize the UML class diagram by ensuring all relationships and attributes are accurately represented as discussed and confirm these changes with the user.

The experts should also consider adding any desired methods, attributes, or relationships for extra functionalities based on the user's preference. Once the final UML class diagram is validated, they can move ahead with the implementation phase of the mobile application project.
