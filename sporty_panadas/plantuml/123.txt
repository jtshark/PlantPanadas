### Request: We need to develop a mobile application that allows users to create workout routines, track their progress and create reminders for upcoming sessions.
### Expert 1: So, we need to design a UML class diagram for a mobile application that includes features for creating workout routines, tracking progress, and setting reminders for upcoming sessions. Where should we start?

### Expert 2: Let's break down the functionality and identify the main components we'll need. First, we should have a class for the User, since they will be creating the routines and tracking their progress. Second, we'll need a class for the Workout Routine itself, which will include exercises, sets, and repetitions. And finally, we should include a Reminder class for managing reminders for upcoming sessions.

### Expert 3: That sounds like a good start. And we could also have a class for Exercise, as each workout routine would consist of multiple exercises.

### Expert 1: Yes, that makes sense. Each exercise could have attributes such as name, description, and possibly difficulty level. We could also include a method to calculate the estimated calories burned during the exercise.

### Expert 2: Exactly! And within the Workout Routine class, we can include a collection or array of Exercise objects. So, a workout routine can have one or more exercises associated with it.

### Expert 3: Great. Now, moving on to the tracking progress feature, we could create a Progress class to keep track of the user's progress in terms of completion status, duration, and number of repetitions performed for each exercise in a workout routine.

### Expert 1: That's a good idea. To implement this, we can have an association between the User class and the Workout Routine class, since each user will have several workout routines. And within that association, we can include an attribute to store the progress made by the user for each routine.

### Expert 2: Agreed. Additionally, for the reminder functionality, we'll need a Reminder class. This class should have attributes such as date, time, and a message to remind the user of an upcoming workout session.

### Expert 3: And we can establish an association between the User class and the Reminder class. That way, each user can have multiple reminders associated with their account.

### Expert 1: Absolutely. Now, to ensure that the user can create multiple workout routines, we should consider having a one-to-many association between the User class and the Workout Routine class. This will allow each user to have multiple routines associated with their account.

### Expert 2: That's correct. And within the Workout Routine class, we may also want to include a method to calculate the total duration of the routine by summing up the durations of all the included exercises.

### Expert 3: That's a good idea. We should also consider if there are any other related features we need to account for, such as data storage or authentication.

### Expert 1: Good point. Data storage could be done using a Database class, which will handle storing and retrieving data related to the User, Workout Routines, Progress, and Reminders.

### Expert 2: And for authentication, we could add a Login class to manage user authentication, login sessions, and account creation.

### Expert 3: I think we have covered most of the required functionality. However, we might need some clarification from the user. Specifically, how would they like to handle exercise-specific information, such as sets and repetitions?

### Expert 1: That's a valid question. We should ask the user if they want us to store sets and repetitions as attributes directly within the Exercise class, or if they prefer a separate class to handle that information.

### Expert 2: Agreed. We should also inquire about any additional information or features they want to include, such as the ability to track weights lifted during the exercises or the option to share progress with others.

### Expert 3: Good points. I think we have a solid understanding of what needs to be included in the UML class diagram for the mobile application. Let's compile our questions and send them to the user for clarification.

### Expert 1: Sounds like a plan. We just need to ensure that everything is properly organized and that all the relationships and associations are represented accurately in the diagram.

### Expert 2: Absolutely, we want to make sure the diagram accurately represents the functionality and interactions of the classes. Once we have the user's clarifications, we can refine the UML class diagram accordingly.
### Instructions: Here is a step-by-step solution for designing the UML class diagram for the mobile application:

1. Create the User class with attributes such as name, email, and password.

2. Create the Workout Routine class with attributes like name, description, and duration.

3. Add an association between User and Workout Routine using multiplication (1-to-many), as one user can have multiple workout routines.

4. Create the Exercise class with attributes like name, description, and difficulty level. Add a method within Exercise to calculate estimated calories burned.

5. Add an association between Workout Routine and Exercise using aggregation (1-to-many), as one routine can include multiple exercises.

6. Create the Progress class with attributes such as completion status, duration, and number of repetitions.

7. Add an association between User and Workout Routine using composition (1-to-many) to store progress information for each routine.

8. Create the Reminder class with attributes like date, time, and message.

9. Add an association between User and Reminder using composition (1-to-many) to manage reminders for each user.

10. Create the Database class to handle data storage for User, Workout Routine, Progress, and Reminder classes.

11. Create the Login class to manage user authentication, login sessions, and account creation.

12. Seek clarification from the user regarding exercise-specific information. Determine if sets and repetitions should be stored within the Exercise class or in a separate class.

13. Inquire about any additional features or information the user wants to include, such as tracking weights lifted or sharing progress with others.

14. Based on user clarifications, make necessary modifications to the UML class diagram.

This solution accurately reflects the steps discussed by the experts and ensures all the required functionalities of the mobile application are addressed.

### PlantUML:
Filename: mobile_application.puml@startuml
class User {
  - name: string
  - email: string
  - password: string
}

class WorkoutRoutine {
  - name: string
  - description: string
  - duration: int
}

User "1" --o "1..*" WorkoutRoutine

class Exercise {
  - name: string
  - description: string
  - difficultyLevel: string
  + calculateCaloriesBurned(): float
}

WorkoutRoutine "1" --* "1..*" Exercise

class Progress {
  - completionStatus: string
  - duration: int
  - repetitions: int
}

User "1" --# "1..*" WorkoutRoutine : has      
WorkoutRoutine "1" --* "1..*" Progress : has

class Reminder {
