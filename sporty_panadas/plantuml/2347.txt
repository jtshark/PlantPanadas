### Request: Our project is a software application that helps users to keep track of their daily tasks and reminders with advanced features like color-coded task categorization and progress monitoring.
### Expert 1: So, we need to design a class diagram for a software application that helps users manage tasks and reminders. It also has additional features like color-coded categories and progress monitoring. Sounds interesting!

### Expert 2: Yes, it does. Let's start by identifying the key classes that will be required for this application. I think we should definitely have a "Task" class, which will represent each individual task.

### Expert 3: Agreed. The "Task" class should have attributes for essential information like the task title, description, due date, and status. We should also include methods to get and set these attributes.

### Expert 1: What about the color-coded categorization feature? Should we add a separate class for the categories?

### Expert 2: Hmm, that's an interesting point. Instead of creating a separate class just for categories, what if we have an attribute within the "Task" class to store the category information? We can include a method to get and set the category as well.

### Expert 3: Yes, that makes sense. We can represent different categories using enumerations or predefined values. This way, a task can belong to one of the predefined categories, identified by a specific value.

### Expert 1: Great, so we have the "Task" class with attributes like title, description, due date, status, and category. What about the progress monitoring feature?

### Expert 2: For progress monitoring, we can include an attribute in the "Task" class to store the percentage of completion. We should also include methods to update and retrieve this information.

### Expert 3: Additionally, we can include a method in the "Task" class to calculate the remaining time until the due date. We can track this based on the current date and the due date of the task.

### Expert 1: That sounds useful. During the progress of a particular task, the due date might change too. Should we include a method to update the due date as well?

### Expert 2: We could do that, but another approach could be to provide a separate "Reminder" class that is associated with each "Task" object. This way, we can store details about reminders for a task, including the due date.

### Expert 3: I agree. By having a separate "Reminder" class, we can easily manage and update reminders independently without modifying the "Task" object directly. This provides more flexibility.

### Expert 1: That makes sense, as it allows us to handle unique reminder-related operations efficiently. 

### Expert 2: Definitely. I think we have covered the major aspects of the requirements mentioned by the user. Though, if we need further clarification or have any implementation doubts, we should consult with the user directly.
### Instructions: Step-by-step solution for designing the class diagram:

1. Create a new class called "Task" to represent each individual task:

   - Add the following attributes:
     - title: string
     - description: string
     - dueDate: date
     - status: enum ['Not started', 'In progress', 'Completed']
     - category: enum ['Personal', 'Work', 'School', 'Miscellaneous']

   - Add the following methods:
     - getTitle(): string
     - getDescription(): string
     - getDueDate(): date
     - getStatus(): string
     - getCategory(): string
     - setTitle(title: string)
     - setDescription(description: string)
     - setDueDate(dueDate: date)
     - setStatus(status: string)
     - setCategory(category: string)
     - getRemainingTime(): duration
     - updateDueDate(newDueDate: date)

2. Create a new class called "Reminder" to represent reminders associated with a task:

   - Add the following attribute:
     - dueDate: date

   - Add the following methods:
     - getDueDate(): date
     - setDueDate(dueDate: date)

3. Create a one-to-one association between the "Task" and "Reminder" classes such that each task can have a single reminder associated with it. Name this association "hasReminder".

4. Add a new attribute to the "Task" class:

   - Add the following attribute:
     - completionPercentage: integer

   - Add the following methods:
     - getCompletionPercentage(): integer
     - setCompletionPercentage(percentage: integer)

5. Create a method in the "Task" class to calculate the remaining time:

   - Add the following method:
     - calculateRemainingTime(): duration

6. Review the class diagram for completeness and accuracy.

7. Implement the class diagram in the software application.

### PlantUML:
Filename: task_manager.puml@startuml
class Task {
  - title: string
  - description: string
  - dueDate: date
  - status: enum ['Not started', 'In progress', 'Completed']
  - category: enum ['Personal', 'Work', 'School', 'Miscellaneous']
  - completionPercentage: integer
  + getTitle(): string
  + getDescription(): string
  + getDueDate(): date
  + getStatus(): string
  + getCategory(): string
  + setTitle(title: string)
  + setDescription(description: string)
  + setDueDate(dueDate: date)
  + setStatus(status: string)
  + setCategory(category: string)
  + getRemainingTime(): duration
  + updateDueDate(newDueDate: date)
}

class Reminder {
  - dueDate: date
  + getDueDate: date
  + setDueDate(dueDate: date)
}

Task "has a" Reminder
