### Request: Our project is to build an online shopping website where customers can browse and purchase products, while the administrators can manage products, track orders, and analyze sales stats.
### Expert 1: So, the user wants us to design a UML class diagram for their online shopping website. We need to include the functionality for customers to browse and purchase products, as well as the functionality for administrators to manage products, track orders, and analyze sales stats.
### Instructions: Step 1: Start by creating the core classes for the online shopping website.

1.1 Create a "Product" class with attributes such as id, title, description, image, price, and quantity.

1.2 Create a "Customer" class with attributes like id, name, email, password, and address.

1.3 Create an "Administrator" class with attributes like id, name, email, password.

1.4 Create an "Order" class with attributes like id, customer, order date, total amount, and status.

1.5 Create an "Analytics" class to handle sales statistics.

Step 2: Define associations between the classes.

2.1 Create a one-to-many association between the "Product" class and the "Order" class. Each order can have multiple products, but each product can belong to a single order.

2.2 Add a one-to-many association between the "Customer" class and the "Order" class. Each customer can have multiple orders, but each order can belong to a single customer.

2.3 Add a one-to-many association between the "Administrator" class and the "Product" class. Each administrator can manage multiple products, but each product can be managed by a single administrator.

2.4 Create a directional association from the "Order" class to the "Analytics" class. Each order contributes to the sales statistics.

Step 3: Add additional features to the class diagram.

3.1 For the "Product" class, include methods to add, edit, and remove products.

3.2 For the "Customer" class, add methods to register, login, and manage their own profile.

3.3 For the "Administrator" class, include methods to manage products, track orders, and view sales statistics.

3.4 Include methods in the "Order" class to modify the order status, track order details, and calculate the total amount.

3.5 In the "Analytics" class, include methods to generate and display sales statistics.

Step 4: Add any additional classes, attributes, or associations required to complete the desired functionality and improve usability.

Please note that this is a basic outline of the steps involved in designing a UML class diagram for the given project requirements. The specific details and implementation can vary based on the design preferences and requirements of the project team.

### PlantUML:
Filename: online_shopping_website.puml
@startuml

class Product {
  - id: int
  - title: string
  - description: string
  - image: string
  - price: float
  - quantity: int

  + addProduct(): void
  + editProduct(): void
  + removeProduct(): void
}

class Customer {
  - id: int
  - name: string
  - email: string
  - password: string
  - address: string

  + register(): void
  + login(): void
  + manageProfile(): void
}

class Administrator {
  - id: int
  - name: string
  - email: string
  - password: string

  + manageProducts(): void
  + trackOrders(): void
  + viewSalesStats(): void
}

class Order {
  - id: int
  - customer: Customer
  - orderDate: date
  - totalAmount: float
  - status: string

  + modifyOrderStatus(newStatus: string): void
  + trackOrderDetails(): void
  + calculateTotalAmount(): void
}

class Analytics {
  + generateSalesStats(): void
  + displaySalesStats(): void
}

Product "1" -up- "0..*" Order
Customer "1" -up- "0..*" Order
Administrator "1" -- "0..*" Product
Order "1" -right-> "1" Analytics
