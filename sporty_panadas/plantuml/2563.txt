### Request: Our project is a mobile app that allows users to make reservations for fitness classes, view class schedules and instructor details.
### Expert 1: So, let's start by understanding the user requirements. They want a mobile app for making reservations for fitness classes, viewing class schedules, and accessing instructor details. Is that correct?

### Expert 2: Yes, that's right. We need to create a UML class diagram for this. But before we proceed, do we have any additional information regarding the requirements? For example, can users only reserve one class at a time or can they book multiple classes?

### Expert 3: That's a good point. Clarifying this will help us decide how to represent the reservation functionality in our class diagram.
### Instructions: Solution:

Step 1: Identify the main classes
- User: Represents a user of the mobile app.
- FitnessClass: Represents a fitness class offered by the app.
- Instructor: Represents an instructor associated with a fitness class.

Step 2: Define attributes for each class
- User: id, name, email, password
- FitnessClass: id, name, capacity, schedule
- Instructor: id, name, email, qualification

Step 3: Define associations between the classes
- Each User can make Reservation(s) for one or more FitnessClass(s).
- Each FitnessClass has one or more Instructor(s).

Step 4: Define additional classes if required
- Reservation: Represents a reservation made by a User for a FitnessClass.

Step 5: Define attributes for the additional classes
- Reservation: id, userId, fitnessClassId, datetime

Step 6: Define associations involving the additional classes (if required)
- User Reservation: Each User can have zero or more Reservations.
- FitnessClass Reservation: Each FitnessClass can have zero or more Reservations.

Step 7: Modify class associations if required based on additional classes
- User FitnessClass: Change multiplicity from one-to-many to many-to-many based on Reservation.

Step 8: Add aggregation/composition relationships, if required
- None in this case.

Step 9: Define methods/views for each class (if required)
- User: makeReservation(Class ID), viewSchedule(), viewInstructorDetails(Instructor ID)
- FitnessClass: getClassSchedule(), getInstructorDetails()
- Instructor: None

Step 10: Finalize the class diagram incorporating all the above changes and decisions.

Class Diagram:
------------------------------------
User 
- id: int
- name: string
- email: string
- password: string
- makeReservation(classId: int)
- viewSchedule()
- viewInstructorDetails(instructorId: int)

FitnessClass 
- id: int
- name: string
- capacity: int
- schedule: string
- getClassSchedule()
- getInstructorDetails()

Instructor 
- id: int
- name: string
- email: string
- qualification: string

Reservation
- id: int
- userId: int
- fitnessClassId: int
- datetime: datetime

User "makes reservations for" FitnessClass
User -(m,n)-{constraint }- FitnessClass
FitnessClass "offers" Instructor
FitnessClass -1------*- Instructor

### PlantUML:
Filename: fitness_app.puml
@startuml

class User {
    -id: int
    -name: string
    -email: string
    -password: string
    +makeReservation(classId: int)
    +viewSchedule()
    +viewInstructorDetails(instructorId: int)
}

class FitnessClass {
    -id: int
    -name: string
    -capacity: int
    -schedule: string
    +getClassSchedule()
    +getInstructorDetails()
}

class Instructor {
    -id: int
    -name: string
    -email: string
    -qualification: string
}

class Reservation {
	  -id: int
    -userId: int
    -fitnessClassId: int
    -datetime: datetime
}

User "makes reservations for" FitnessClass
User -- Reservation
FitnessClass --|> Reservation
FitnessClass "offers" Instructor
FitnessClass *-- Instructor
