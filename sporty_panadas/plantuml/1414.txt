### Request: My project is to create a mobile app that helps users track their daily water intake and reminds them to drink more water throughout the day. The app should include features such as a daily goal tracker, report screens, and customizable reminder notifications.
### Expert 1: Hi everyone! So, we have a user request to design a UML class diagram for a water intake tracking mobile app. The app has features like a goal tracker, report screens, and reminder notifications. 

### Expert 2: That sounds interesting. To start with, let's think about the main components of the app. We can have classes for users, goals, water intake records, and reminders. Additionally, we might need classes for generating reports. 

### Expert 3: Absolutely. Let's begin with the User class. It will should include attributes like name, age, weight, and gender. Since our app will be tracking water intake over time, it might be valuable to also include attributes like dailyWaterGoal and totalWaterIntake.

### Expert 1: Agreed. I also think it would be helpful to have a method in the User class that calculates and returns the percentage of the daily water goal achieved based on the totalWaterIntake attribute.

### Expert 2: Good point. It could also be relevant to have classes for the goal and water intake records. The Goal class could have attributes like goalAmount and deadlineDate. And the WaterIntakeRecord class could have attributes like timestamp, amountInMilliliters, and a reference to the User who made the record.

### Expert 3: I think we should also consider a class for managing reminders. We can call it the Reminder class, which includes attributes like reminderMessage and timeOfReminder. Additionally, we can associate each reminder with a specific User by having a User reference within the Reminder class.

### Expert 1: That makes sense. And to make things even more efficient, we could include a method in the Reminder class that sends the reminder notification using some built-in feature of the mobile app's operating system.

### Expert 2: Great idea! Lastly, we should consider having some classes to generate reports, as requested. Maybe a Report class that includes attributes like startDate and endDate to define the range of dates for the generated report.

### Expert 3: Yes, and this Report class could include a method that queries the database for WaterIntakeRecords within the specified date range and returns the necessary information like total water intake or daily average.

### Expert 1: Exactly. Are there any other features or classes we should consider at this point?

### Expert 2: That pretty much covers the main aspects of the app based on the user's request. But we might still need some clarifications from the user. For example, it would be useful to know if there are any specific requirements for the report screens and the customizable reminder notifications.

### Expert 3: Agreed. Clarifying these details will help us design a more accurate UML class diagram that aligns with the user's expectations. 

### Expert 1: We can send a message to the user asking for clarification. Should we proceed with that?
### Instructions: 1. Create a class named User with attributes:
   - name: string
   - age: integer
   - weight: decimal
   - gender: string
   - dailyWaterGoal: decimal
   - totalWaterIntake: decimal

2. In the User class, create a method called calculateWaterIntakePercentageToGoal that returns a decimal representing the percentage of the daily water goal achieved based on the totalWaterIntake attribute.

3. Create a class named Goal with attributes:
   - goalAmount: decimal
   - deadlineDate: date 

4. Create a class named WaterIntakeRecord with attributes:
   - timestamp: datetime
   - amountInMilliliters: decimal
   - user: User

5. Create a class named Reminder with attributes:
   - reminderMessage: string
   - timeOfReminder: datetime
   - user: User

6. In the Reminder class, create a method called sendReminderNotification that sends the reminder using the mobile app's built-in notification mechanism.

7. Create a class named Report with attributes:
   - startDate: date
   - endDate: date

8. In the Report class, create a method called generateReport that queries the database for WaterIntakeRecords within the specified date range and returns relevant information for the report, such as total water intake or daily average.

9. Establish a association relationship between User and Goal classes, where a user can set multiple goals but a goal belongs to one user.

10. Establish an association relationship between User and WaterIntakeRecord classes, where a user can have multiple water intake records.

11. Establish an association relationship between User and Reminder classes, where a user can have multiple reminders.

12. Establish an association relationship between Report and WaterIntakeRecord classes, where a report can be generated using multiple water intake records.

13. If necessary, define additional classes for related entities, such as classes for generating reports analyzing trends, etc.

Filename: water_intake_app.puml

class User {
  -name: string
  -age: integer
  -weight: decimal
  -gender: string
  -dailyWaterGoal: decimal
  -totalWaterIntake: decimal
  +calculateWaterIntakePercentageToGoal(): decimal
}

class Goal {
  -goalAmount: decimal
  -deadlineDate: date
}

class WaterIntakeRecord {
  -timestamp: datetime
  -amountInMilliliters: decimal
  -user: User
}

class Reminder {
  -reminderMessage: string
  -timeOfReminder: datetime
  -user: User
  +sendReminderNotification(): void
}

class Report {
  -startDate: date
  -endDate: date
  +generateReport(): void
}

User "1" --> "0..*" Goal
User "1" --> "0..*" WaterIntakeRecord
User "1" --> "0..*" Reminder
Report "1" --> "0..*" WaterIntakeRecord
