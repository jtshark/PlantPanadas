### Request: A social media application allowing users to create, post, and exchange photos, videos, messages, and comments with their chosen friends and followers, while receiving news updates and promotions from brands and influencers.
### Expert 1: So we've been tasked with designing a UML class diagram for a social media application. Let's start by defining the main entities involved. 
### Expert 2: Agreed. First off, we should have a User class to represent the users of the application. They will have attributes like username, email, and password for authentication purposes. They will also have a list of friends and followers. 
### Expert 3: Good point. And since photos and videos are mentioned in the user request, we should have a Post class for the content that users can create and share. This class can have attributes like caption, media files, and likes count.
### Expert 1: Absolutely. We also need a Messaging class to model user messages where users can send texts, photos, videos privately to each other. This should have attributes like sender, receiver, message content, and timestamp.
### Expert 2: Additionally, we should consider having a Comment class to allow users to comment on posts and messages. This class can have attributes like comment text, commenter, and timestamp. It would also have a relationship with the Post class.
### Expert 3: That makes sense. Now, what about the news updates and promotions from brands and influencers? Should we have separate classes for them?
### Expert 1: You're right. Instead of cluttering the User class, we can have a separate class called Notification which can hold information about news updates and promotions. It would have attributes like notification content, source, and timestamp.
### Expert 2: Agreed. But should we consider having a separate entity for brands and influencers?
### Expert 3: I think it would be logical to have a UserProfile class that can be subclassed for User, Brand, and Influencer. This way, we can have different properties and behaviors specific to each type, such as a verified status for brands and a follower count for influencers.
### Expert 1: That's a good idea. It provides more flexibility in terms of adding specific attributes for each type of user profile. Is there anything else we're missing?
### Expert 2: We should also think about associations between the entities. For example, a User would have a one-to-many relationship with posts since they can have multiple posts. Similarly, there would be associations between users for the friend and follower relationships.
### Expert 3: And don't forget the associations between comments and posts. A post can have multiple comments, forming a one-to-many relationship.
### Expert 1: Right. We should also consider adding methods in the classes to perform actions like create, delete, and update posts, messages, comments, and profiles. Additionally, we could have methods to handle actions like liking, sharing posts, and following or unfollowing users.
### Expert 2: Makes sense. This way, we can encapsulate the behavior and functional logic within the relevant classes. It also helps in maintaining the system's integrity.
### Expert 3: I agree. And for attributes like date of birth or price, we could have methods like getAge and getDiscountedPrice respectively to calculate the age or the final price based on specific date or discount logic.
### Expert 1: That's a good point. By storing the individual attributes like date and price, we can have more flexibility in modifying the behavior related to them without altering the class attributes themselves.
### Expert 2: Exactly. It helps keep the class diagram clean and avoids unnecessary duplication. Overall, it looks like we've covered all the major requirements for the UML class diagram of this social media application.
### Expert 3: Agreed. Now, we can start iterating on this initial design based on further clarifications from the user if needed.
### Instructions: Step-by-Step Solution:

1. Create a class called "User" with attributes like username, email, and password.
2. Add a list data structure to the User class to represent friends and followers.
3. Create a class called "Post" with attributes like caption, media files, and likes count.
4. Add an association between User and Post classes to represent their relationship (e.g., users can create multiple posts).
5. Create a class called "Messaging" with attributes like sender, receiver, message content, and timestamp.
6. Create a class called "Comment" with attributes like comment text, commenter, and timestamp.
7. Add an association between the Comment and Post classes to represent the fact that a post can have multiple comments.
8. Create a class called "Notification" with attributes like notification content, source, and timestamp.
9. Add methods in relevant classes to handle actions like creating, deleting, and updating posts, messages, comments, and user profiles.
10. Create a super class called "UserProfile" that can be subclassed for User, Brand, and Influencer profiles.
11. Define specific properties and behaviors for each subclass (e.g., verified status for brands, follower count for influencers).
12. Add associations between classes for relationships like users befriending each other and following.
13. Designate appropriate multiplicities and cardinalities for associations where needed (e.g., a User can have many friends).
14. Include additional methods that manage interactions like liking, sharing posts, following or unfollowing users, etc.
15. Implement specific methods within classes to calculate values based on certain input parameters or logic (e.g., a getAge method based on a User's date of birth input).
16. Test and refine the class diagram as necessary based on further clarification from the user.

Note: This step-by-step solution provides a guideline for crafting the class diagram design by covering key aspects discussed by the experts. Ongoing communication with the user and finer details might still be required for a complete and accurate implementation.
