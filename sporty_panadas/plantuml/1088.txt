### Request: Develop a mobile application that allows users to find nearby restaurants, view menus and make reservations.
### Expert 1: So the user wants a mobile app that helps them find nearby restaurants, view menus, and make reservations. The first step to designing a class diagram for this would be to identify the main entities involved. Any suggestions?

### Expert 2: Yes, I think the main entities would be User, Restaurant, Menu, and Reservation. These seem like logical starting points.

### Expert 3: Agreed. We should start by defining the attributes and methods for each of these entities. For User, we'll definitely need a username, password, and some basic personal information like name and contact details. We might also include attributes like preferences or dietary restrictions, if the user wants to personalize their experience.

### Expert 1: That sounds good. As for Restaurant, we may need attributes like name, address, cuisine, and ratings. What about Menu? I think it would have attributes like list of dishes, prices, and perhaps a brief description.

### Expert 2: Absolutely. Menu can also potentially be connected to Restaurant, as each menu belongs to a specific restaurant. As for Reservation, it needs to track attributes like the reservation date and time, number of guests, and which user made the reservation at which specific restaurant.

### Expert 3: That sounds appropriate. But how should Reservations be connected to User and Restaurant? Should it be a many-to-many relationship?

### Expert 1: I think Reservation would have a one-to-many relationship with both User and Restaurant. A user can potentially make multiple reservations, and each restaurant can have multiple reservations from different users.

### Expert 2: Good point. Also, when a user looks for nearby restaurants, we should add a location attribute to both User and Restaurant so we can calculate the distance between them. This way, the user can see results within a certain radius.

### Expert 1: That makes perfect sense. Additionally, we should consider how the user will interact with the app. Since they want to view menus and make reservations, should we add methods like viewMenu() and makeReservation() to their corresponding classes?

### Expert 3: I agree. And for the Restaurant class, it might also be helpful to include a method like getAvailability() to check if there are any open reservation slots for a specified date and time.

### Expert 2: Definitely. To improve the user experience, we could also think about adding features like user reviews, so we need to look into implementing a rating attribute for both User and Restaurant.

### Expert 1: I completely agree. Adding the review feature along with the rating will add value to the overall user experience in the app.

### Expert 3: I think we have a good understanding of the main entities and their attributes and methods. Do we need to seek any clarifications from the user before proceeding further?

### Expert 2: Just one clarification. Should the restaurant menus be static or dynamic? In other words, are menus fixed or can they change frequently?

### Expert 1: That's a great point. If menus are constantly changing, we might even need a separate class for different menu versions and have that connected to the Restaurant class.

### Expert 3: Absolutely, and it would also be important to clarify if the users should have the ability to make changes to their reservations or whether they can cancel them.

### Expert 2: Agreed. I can definitely see how that functionality would be crucial, so a modification would be well needed in the Reservation class.

### Expert 1: Great. So to recap, we have User, Restaurant, Menu, and Reservation as our main entities. We've defined their attributes and methods and discussed some possible additional features. I believe with these clarified aspects, we can go ahead and start sketching the UML class diagram.

### Expert 3: Agreed. Let's start working on that then.
### Instructions: Step-by-step Solution:

1. Create a class called User with the following attributes:
   - username: string
   - password: string
   - name: string
   - contactDetails: string

2. Create a class called Restaurant with the following attributes:
   - name: string
   - address: string
   - cuisine: string
   - ratings: float

3. Add a location attribute to the User class:
   - location: string

4. Add a location attribute to the Restaurant class:
   - location: string

5. Create a class called Menu with the following attributes:
   - dishes: list of strings
   - prices: list of floats
   - descriptions: list of strings

6. Update the Restaurant class with a reference to the Menu class:
   - menu: Menu

7. Create a class called Reservation with the following attributes:
   - dateAndTime: datetime
   - numberOfGuests: int

8. Add a reference to the User class in the Reservation class:
   - user: User

9. Add a reference to the Restaurant class in the Reservation class:
   - restaurant: Restaurant

10. Create a class called Review with the following attributes:
    - rating: float
    - comment: string

11. Add a list of Review objects as an attribute to the User class:
    - reviews: list of Reviews

12. Add a list of Review objects as an attribute to the Restaurant class:
    - reviews: list of Reviews

13. Add a method to the User class for viewing menus:
    - viewMenu()
    
14. Add a method to the User class for making reservations:
    - makeReservation()

15. Add a method to the Restaurant class for checking availability:
    - getAvailability(dateAndTime)

16. Add a method to the Restaurant class for adding reviews:
    - addReview(rating, comment)
  
17. Add a method to the User class for adding reviews:
    - addReview(rating, comment)

This step-by-step solution provides a clear guide on creating the necessary classes, defining attributes for these classes, creating associations between classes as required, and adding the appropriate methods to facilitate the desired functionality.
