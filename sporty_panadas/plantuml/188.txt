### Request: My project is a mobile application where users can create and share custom workout routines, track their progress, and connect with friends to share achievements and provide encouragement.
### Expert 1: So we need to design a UML class diagram for a mobile application that allows users to create workout routines, track progress, and connect with friends. Let's start by identifying the main classes we'll need.

### Expert 2: Agreed. First, we'll need a User class to represent each individual user of the app. This would allow them to create, save, and view their workout routines and track progress.

### Expert 3: Absolutely. And let's include attributes like their name, email, and username, as well as methods for creating and managing workouts and tracking progress.

### Expert 1: Good. Now, we also need a Workout class to represent a specific workout routine. It should have attributes such as a title, description, and duration.

### Expert 2: Right. Additionally, we could include a list of exercises or steps within the Workout class to give users a more detailed breakdown of the routine.

### Expert 3: Agreed. And since users can connect with friends on this app, we'll need a Friends class. It can have attributes like 'fullName' and 'username', and methods to connect with, view, and interact with friends.

### Expert 1: We haven't discussed the feature to track progress in detail. Should we add an attribute for that to the Workout class?

### Expert 2: I think it would be better to have a separate Progress class. This way, a User can have multiple progress instances for different workouts.

### Expert 3: Absolutely. The Progress class can have attributes like date, duration, and whether the user completed the workout. And it would also have a reference to the User that tracked the progress.

### Expert 1: Makes sense. And to facilitate sharing and encouragement, what about including an Achievement class? It can have attributes representing the type of achievement earned, like a badge or a workout milestone.

### Expert 2: Yes, and the User class could have a method to track and retrieve achievements. Plus, we could introduce an Association class called Sharing to represent a relationship between the User class and the achievements they share with friends.

### Expert 3: Indeed. It would have attributes like dateShared and friend, indicating the friendship context. We could even include methods to retrieve shared achievements and thank friends for their encouragement.

### Expert 1: Great! I think we have the basic structure of our UML class diagram. It covers workout creation, tracking progress, connecting with friends, and sharing achievements.

### Expert 2: Agreed. Now, we may need to seek clarification from the user on a few things. Is it possible for workouts to have different levels of difficulty?

### Expert 3: Good point. ### QUESTION: Can workouts have different levels of difficulty? 
### Answer:  Yes, workouts can have different levels of difficulty.
### Expert 1: Thank you for confirming. In that case, we should consider adding an attribute to the Workout class called "difficulty" which can have values like easy, intermediate, and advanced.

### Expert 2: That's a good addition. It will help users filter and choose workouts based on their preferred difficulty level.

### Expert 3: Agreed. And just to clarify, can users customize their workout routines by adding or removing exercises?

### Expert 1: Good question. Should we also include an attribute in the Workout class to handle customizations?

### Expert 2: Possibly..Question: Can users customize their workout routines by adding or removing exercises? 
### Instructions: Here is a step-by-step solution for designing the UML class diagram:

1. Create a User class with attributes like name, email, and username.

2. Add methods in the User class to allow for creating and managing workouts and tracking progress.

3. Create a Workout class with attributes such as title, description, duration, and difficulty.

4. Include a list of exercises/steps within the Workout class to specify the routine in detail.

5. Create a Friends class with attributes like fullName and username.

6. Add methods in the Friends class to connect with, view, and interact with friends.

7. Create a Progress class with attributes like date, duration, and completion status.

8. Add a reference to the User class in the Progress class to establish the connection.

9. Include a separate Achievement class with attributes representing the type of achievement (e.g., badge or milestone).

10. Add a method in the User class to track and retrieve achievements.

11. Introduce an Association class called Sharing to represent the relationship between the User class and the achievements they share with friends.

12. Include attributes in the Sharing class like dateShared and friend to indicate the context of the friendship.

13. Add methods in the Sharing class to retrieve shared achievements and thank friends for their encouragement.

14. Optionally, add an attribute to the Workout class to specify customizations by users.

15. Consider including additional methods or attributes based on any specific requirements or user clarifications.

This sequence of steps ensures a sequential and logical design process, allowing for the creation, association, and management of classes and their attributes, ensuring the implementation meets the desired functionality of the mobile application.

### PlantUML:
Filename: mobile_application_workout_tracker.puml

```plantuml
@startuml

class User {
    - name: string
    - email: string
    - username: string
    + createWorkout(): void
    + manageWorkout(): void
    + trackProgress(): void
}

class Workout {
    - title: string
    - description: string
    - duration: int
    - difficulty: string
    + addExercise(): void
    + removeExercise(): void
}

class Friends {
    - fullName: string
    - username: string
    + connectFriend(): void
    + viewFriends(): void
    + interactFriend(): void
}

class Progress {
    - date: date
    - duration: int
    - completionStatus: bool
}

class Achievement {
    - type: string
}

class Sharing {
    - dateShared: date
    - friend: string
    + retrieveAchievements(): void
    + thankFriend(): void
}

User "1" *--> "many" Workout
User "1"--* Progress
User "1"--* Achievement
User "1" o--> "many" Sharing
Workout "1" *--> "many" Exercise
Sharing "1" *--> Achievement
