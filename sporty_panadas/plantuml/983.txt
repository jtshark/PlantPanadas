### Request: I need a UML model for my project creating a mobile application that allows users to find nearby restaurants, view menus, and place food orders within the app.
### Expert 1: So, we need to create a UML class diagram for a mobile app that provides restaurant search, menu viewing, and food ordering features.

### Expert 2: That's correct. Let's start by identifying the main actors in this system. We have the user, who will interact with the app, and the restaurants, which will provide their information.

### Expert 3: Agreed. And since we will be dealing with restaurant information, it would be logical to have a class called "Restaurant" to represent each restaurant.

### Expert 1: Definitely. We can further refine the attributes and methods of the Restaurant class as we discuss the requirements. For now, let's move to the next important class, which is the User class.

### Expert 2: Right. The User class will have attributes such as name, address, phone number, email, and maybe even a payment method if we want to handle orders.

### Expert 3: Yes, and in addition to these attributes, we should also include relevant methods in the User class, such as methods for placing an order, viewing menus, and searching for restaurants.

### Expert 1: Agreed. Now, let's move on to the main functionality of the app, which is searching for nearby restaurants.

### Expert 2: We could create a class called "Search" to encapsulate the searching functionality. This class would have methods like "searchByLocation" and "searchByCuisine" to help users find restaurants based on specific parameters.

### Expert 3: Good idea. And to link it with the User and Restaurant classes, we can also create an association between the User and Search classes. This way, the User can use the methods provided by the Search class to find restaurants.

### Expert 1: Makes sense. Now, let's think about the menu viewing and food ordering features. How can we include them in our class diagram?

### Expert 2: We can create a class called "Menu" associated with the Restaurant class to represent each restaurant's menu. This class would have a method to retrieve the menu items.

### Expert 3: And for food ordering, we should create an Order class that includes attributes such as the selected menu items and total price. Moreover, this Order class should be associated with both the User and Restaurant classes.

### Expert 1: Makes perfect sense. Any other thoughts, guys?

### Expert 2: We could also consider including other classes like "Review" to represent user reviews for each restaurant. This class would be associated with the User and Restaurant classes as well.

### Expert 3: I agree. It's valuable to provide a means for users to share their experiences with others. Including a Review class is a great way to enhance the functionality of the app.

### Expert 1: Absolutely. So, let's summarize what we have so far: we have the User, Restaurant, Search, Menu, Order, and Review classes. The User class has associations with the Search and Order classes, while the Restaurant class has associations with the Menu, Search, Order, and Review classes. 

### Expert 2: Looks like we've captured the main features of the app in our UML diagram. Now we can further refine the attributes and methods for each class and identify any potential relationships.

### Expert 3: Indeed. We can define multiplicity and add any necessary additional attributes or methods to ensure the diagram reflects the specific requirements of our user.
### Instructions: 1. Create a new UML class diagram for the mobile application.
2. Add the User class with attributes like name, address, phone number, email, and any additional attributes required, such as payment info.
3. Add appropriate methods to the User class for placing an order, viewing menus, and searching for restaurants.
4. Create a Restaurant class with relevant attributes like name, address, and opening hours.
5. Add a Menu class associated with the Restaurant class to represent each restaurant's menu.
6. Include a method in the Menu class to retrieve menu items.
7. Create an Order class with attributes like selected menu items and total price for handling food orders.
8. Establish associations between the User and Search classes by adding a navigation association, such as User -> Search.
9. Similarly, link the User and Order classes with a navigation association like User -> Order.
10. Establish an association between the Restaurant and Menu classes, such as Restaurant 1 -> Menu * (many menus).
11. Create an association between the Restaurant and Review classes to allow users to leave reviews for a restaurant, like Restaurant -> Review * (many reviews).
12. Add any additional attributes and methods necessary for the classes, depending on the specific requirements or features desired.
13. Determine the multiplicity for each association (e.g., 1-to-1, 1-to-many, or many-to-many).
14. Review the UML class diagram for completeness and accuracy making any necessary adjustments.
15. Repeat or modify the steps as needed until the UML class diagram effectively represents the mobile application's requirements.


### PlantUML:
Filename: mobile_app_restaurant.puml 

@startuml
class User {
  - name : String
  - address : String
  - phone number : String
  - email : String
  + placeOrder() : void
  + viewMenu() : void
  + searchRestaurants() : void
  + addPaymentInfo() : void
}
class Restaurant {
  - name : String
  - address : String
  - opening hours : String
}
class Menu {
  - menu items : List<String>
  + retrieveMenuItems() : List<String>
}

class Order {
  - selected menu items : List<Menu Item>
  - totalPrice : double
}

User "1" --> "1" Search
User "1" --> "*" Review
User --> Order

Restaurant 1 --> "*" Review
Restaurant 1 --> "*" Menu

Review "*" --> "1" User
Review "*" --> "1" Restaurant
