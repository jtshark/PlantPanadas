### Request: Our project is about designing a website for an online boutique where customers can browse and purchase clothing, accessories and footwear items, while the business owner can manage and update product inventory, process orders, and run promotions.
### Expert 1: So, let's start by discussing the main entities involved in this system. We have customers, products (clothing, accessories, and footwear), orders, and the business owner. Does that sound about right?

### Expert 2: Yes, that seems to cover the basics. We could also consider adding some additional entities like promotions or discounts if we think they will play a substantial role in the system.

### Expert 3: That's a good point. For now, let's focus on the core entities and we can always revisit and add more later if necessary. First off, let's dive into the customer entity. What attributes do we need to represent for a customer in our system?

### Expert 1: Well, we definitely need to store the customer's personal information like their name, email, and address. We might also want to keep track of their order history, so we can know their preferences and provide personalized recommendations.

### Expert 2: Absolutely. I think it would also be helpful to save the customer's registration date, as well as any relevant payment information like credit card details.

### Expert 3: Agreed. Another thing to consider is saving the customer's shopping cart so that they can easily navigate through the catalogue and add items to their cart, even if they leave the website and return later.

### Expert 1: Good point. It might be useful to have a method to calculate and retrieve the customer's age as well, based on their date of birth. That way, we don't have to update the age every year.

### Expert 2: That makes sense. So, we can save the date of birth attribute and have a corresponding method like getAge() to compute and retrieve the customer's age whenever needed. This will ensure the age is always accurate without requiring regular updates.

### Expert 3: Agreed. Now, let's shift focus to the product entity. What attributes do we need to capture for each clothing, accessory, or footwear item?

### Expert 1: We definitely need attributes like name, description, and price for each product. We should also record the available quantity in stock to ensure that customers are not able to purchase more than what is readily available.

### Expert 2: Absolutely. We might also want to save other details like brand, color, size, and maybe even ratings and reviews from previous customers. Offering size guides or displaying related products could enhance the user experience.

### Expert 3: That's a good idea. It might also be helpful to capture when a product was added to the inventory so that the business owner can maintain a well-curated collection by monitoring which items are staying in stock for too long.

### Expert 1: Great point. Now, let's think about the order entity. What attributes should we include for orders?

### Expert 2: Well, we definitely need to link the order to the customer who placed it. So, we need an attribute that references the customer either directly or through a unique identifier.

### Expert 3: Agreed. Additionally, we should save the details of each product that was ordered, including the quantity. This information will be crucial not just for the customer but also for the business owner to keep track of inventory and manage deliveries.

### Expert 1: Absolutely. We also need attributes to capture the order date, payment status, and shipping information like address and delivery method. These details will help streamline the internal workflow and ensure smooth order processing.

### Expert 2: I agree with all those attributes. I have one more thing to consider - what if a customer wants to apply a discount or promotion to their order? Should we introduce a separate attribute for that?

### Expert 3: That's an interesting point. Instead of saving a price and a discounted price for each product, it might make more sense to save a price and a discount attribute for the product. Then, we can have a method like getDiscountedPrice() that applies the discount and gives the final price at the time of order placement. This approach will facilitate any changes to discounts or promotions in the future.

### Expert 1: I like that idea. It would ensure that the prices displayed are in sync with any ongoing promotions and discounts, without having to update every product individually.

### Expert 2: Fantastic. I think we have a good foundational understanding of the entities and attributes we need for this system. Our next step would be to design the relationship between these entities by incorporating associations like a customer having multiple orders and each order having multiple products.

### Expert 3: Definitely. We will also need to consider any additional methods or operations that may be required to perform specific actions, like managing orders, updating inventory, or running promotions. Those methods will tie everything together and make the system functional.

### Expert 1: Agreed. Once we have a clear picture of the relationships and methods, we can then dive into designing the UML class diagram to visually represent the structure and functionality of the system.

### Expert 2: That sounds like a plan. Let's gather more specific requirements, if needed, by seeking clarification from the user. From there, we can proceed with our design.
### Instructions: Step 1: Create a class called "Customer" with the following attributes:
   - name: String
   - email: String
   - address: String
   - orderHistory: List of Order
   - registrationDate: Date
   - paymentInfo: String
   - shoppingCart: List of Products

Step 2: Create a class called "Product" with the following attributes:
   - name: String
   - description: String
   - price: double
   - brand: String
   - color: String
   - size: String
   - ratings: List of int
   - reviews: List of String
   - addedToInventory: Date
   - quantityInStock: int

Step 3: Create a class called "Order" with the following attributes:
   - customer: Customer
   - products: List of Product
   - orderDate: Date
   - paymentStatus: String
   - shippingAddress: String
   - deliveryMethod: String

Step 4: Define the association relationships between classes:
   - Customer has a *-1 association with Order (Customer can have multiple orders)
   - Order has a *-1 association with Customer (Order is placed by a single customer)
   - Order has a *-* association with Product (An order can contain multiple products, and a product can be in multiple orders)

Step 5: Define any additional methods for each class, if necessary. For example:
   - Customer class could have a method getAge() to calculate and retrieve the customer's age based on their date of birth.
   - Product class could have a method getDiscountedPrice() that applies any active discounts or promotions to calculate and retrieve the final price for the product.

Step 6: If promotions or discounts play a substantial role in the system, add a class called "Promotion" with the following attributes:
   - name: String
   - discount: double
   - startDate: Date
   - endDate: Date

Step 7: Update the Product class to include an attribute "promotion" that references the active Promotion for that product, if applicable.

Step 8 (Optional): As the project progresses, keep refining the class diagram as more details and requirements are uncovered.

### PlantUML:
Filename: online_boutique.puml@startuml

  - name: String
  - email: String
  - address: String
  - orderHistory: List of Order
  - registrationDate: Date
  - paymentInfo: String
  - shoppingCart: List of Products
  + getAge(): int
}

class Product {
  - name: String
  - description: String
  - price: double
  - brand: String
  - color: String
  - size: String
  - ratings: List of int
  - reviews: List of String
  - addedToInventory: Date
  - quantityInStock: int
  ~ promotion: Promotion
  + getDiscountedPrice(): double
}

class Order {
  - customer: Customer
  - products: List of Product
  - orderDate: Date
  - paymentStatus: String
  - shippingAddress: String
  - deliveryMethod: String
}

class Promotion {
  - name: String
  - discount: double
  - startDate: Date
  - endDate: Date
}

Order "1" -- "many" Product
Product "1" -- "0..1" Promotion
