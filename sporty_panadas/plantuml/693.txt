### Request: We need an UML model for our online store that sells clothing where customers can browse products, add items to their shopping cart, check out and pay securely, and view their order history.
### Expert 1: Alright, so we need to design a UML class diagram for an online store that sells clothing. 
### Expert 2: That's right. We should first identify the main entities involved. I can think of 'Customer', 'Product', 'ShoppingCart', and 'Order'.
### Expert 3: Great, let's start with 'Customer' first. What attributes should we include? I believe we need 'name', 'email', and 'password' at least.
### Expert 1: Agreed. Those are essential attributes. Additionally, we can consider adding 'address', 'phone number', and 'payment information'.
### Expert 2: True. This kind of information is usually necessary for smooth checkout processing and order delivery. Each customer might also have a unique 'customerId' attribute.
### Expert 3: Exactly. Now, let's move on to 'Product'. It should have attributes like 'productId', 'name', 'price', 'description', maybe 'imageUrl', and even 'quantityAvailable'.
### Expert 1: Right. Alongside those attributes, we should also consider methods such as 'getAvailableQuantity' that returns the available quantity of a product after considering all active orders.
### Expert 2: That's a good point. By having a method like that, we can avoid any inconsistencies in the available quantity shown on the website.
### Expert 3: Absolutely. Moving on to 'ShoppingCart.' This represents the customer's current selected items. We should link it to both 'Customer' and 'Product', so we know which customer it belongs to and what products are in it.
### Expert 1: Agreed. It would be a good idea to add a 'timeCreated' attribute to keep track of when the shopping cart was created and any other relevant attributes like 'discountsApplied.'
### Expert 2: True. And for the 'Order' entity, we'll need attributes like 'orderId', 'customerId', 'products', 'totalAmount', 'shippingAddress', 'status', and 'paymentMethod'.
### Expert 3: Definitely. Additionally, we may even consider including attributes such as 'createdAt' and 'updatedAt' for better record-keeping and tracking the order status changes.
### Expert 1: Well said. We must also ensure that the 'totalAmount' attribute is calculated accurately. 
### Expert 2: Right. We can create a method that calculates the total amount by summing up the prices of the products in the order.
### Expert 3: Agreed. And before we wrap up, we need to make sure we capture the relationship between these entities correctly. For example, 'Customer' has a one-to-many relationship with 'ShoppingCart' as multiple shopping carts can belong to a single customer.
### Expert 1: Yes. And similarly, 'ShoppingCart' has a many-to-many relationship with 'Product'. Multiple products can be added to one cart, and one product can exist in multiple carts.
### Expert 2: Exactly. Finally, 'Order' has a one-to-many relationship with both 'Customer' and 'Product'.
### Expert 3: Great. I think we have covered everything according to the user's request. Now, we can start implementing this in code by leveraging the power of UML.
### Expert 1: Agreed. But before that, if any ambiguities or uncertainties arise, we should reach out to the user for clarification. This way, we can ensure greater accuracy in our diagram.
### Expert 2: That's a good point. We should approach the user with any remaining questions and seek their input.
### Expert 3: Absolutely. Let's finalize our UML class diagram and collaborate on creating the code implementation based on it.
### Instructions: Solution:

1. Create a class called 'Customer' with attributes:
   - name: string
   - email: string
   - password: string
   - address: string (optional)
   - phoneNumber: string (optional)
   - paymentInformation: string (optional)

2. Create a class called 'Product' with attributes:
   - productId: int
   - name: string
   - price: double
   - description: string
   - imageUrl: string (optional)
   - quantityAvailable: int

3. Create a class called 'ShoppingCart' with attributes:
   - customerId: int (foreign key, links to 'Customer' class)
   - timeCreated: Date
   - discountsApplied: string (optional)

4. Create a class called 'Order' with attributes:
   - orderId: int
   - customerId: int (foreign key, links to 'Customer' class)
   - products: List<Product>
   - totalAmount: double
   - shippingAddress: string
   - status: string
   - paymentMethod: string
   - createdAt: Date
   - updatedAt: Date

5. Add methods to the 'Product' class:
   - getAvailableQuantity(): int

6. Ensure associations between classes are defined correctly:
   - 'Customer' has a one-to-many association with 'ShoppingCart'.
   - 'ShoppingCart' has a many-to-many association with 'Product'.
   - 'Customer' has a one-to-many association with 'Order'.
   - 'Product' has a one-to-many association with 'Order'.

7. Implement any additional methods required in the code base, based on the UML diagram.

Note: The above solution is a high-level explanation. The actual implementation may vary depending on the programming language and specific requirements. Consider reaching out to the user for any clarifications before finalizing the design.

### PlantUML:
Filename: online_store.puml

```plantuml
@startuml
class Customer {
  - name: string
  - email: string
  - password: string
  - address: string
  - phoneNumber: string
  - paymentInformation: string
}

class Product {
  - productId: int
  - name: string
  - price: double
  - description: string
  - imageUrl: string
  - quantityAvailable: int
  + getAvailableQuantity(): int
}

class ShoppingCart {
  - customerId: int
  - timeCreated: Date
  - discountsApplied: string
}

class Order {
  - orderId: int
  - customerId: int
  - products: List<Product>
  - totalAmount: double
  - shippingAddress: string
  - status: string
  - paymentMethod: string
  - createdAt: Date
  - updatedAt: Date
}

Customer "1" --> "*" ShoppingCart
ShoppingCart "1" --> "*" Product
Customer "1" --> "*" Order
Product "1" --> "*" Order
