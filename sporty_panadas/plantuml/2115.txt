### Request: My project is to develop a system to manage customer requests and feedback towards our company's product and services, while enabling employees to track and resolve these requests efficiently and effectively.
### Expert 1: So it seems like the main functionality here is to manage customer requests and feedback, as well as provide a way for employees to track and resolve those requests. We'll need to represent customers, their requests and feedback, and also the employees and their actions, right?

### Expert 2: Yes, that's right. I think we can start by identifying the main entities in this system. We'll definitely need a Customer class to represent customers. And I imagine we'll need a Request class to represent the customer requests.

### Expert 3: Agreed. But what about feedback? Should we treat it as a separate entity or associate it with the requests?

### Expert 1: That's a good point. Let's discuss the relationship between feedback and requests. Are they always associated or can there be standalone Feedback objects?

### Expert 2: Well, in many cases, feedback is given as part of a request. Think of someone complaining about a specific issue or suggesting an improvement while submitting a request. But standalone feedback is possible too, like when customers provide unsolicited comments or reviews.

### QUESTION: Are standalone feedback instances allowed or are they always associated with a request? 
### Answer:  Standalone feedback instances are allowed and can exist without a request being submitted.
### Expert 3: Got it. In that case, it would be better to have a separate Feedback class, independent of the Request class. This way, we can accommodate both standalone feedback instances and feedback associated with requests.

### Expert 1: Great, so we'll add a Feedback class to our diagram. Now, moving on to the employee side, we'll need to represent them and their actions. I propose we create an Employee class to represent each employee.

### Expert 2: Yes, and we should also think about the different types of actions employees can take. For example, they might need to assign a request to other employees, provide updates on the status of requests, or mark a request as resolved.

### Expert 3: Exactly. So we should consider having an Action class which can capture these different actions. We can give it attributes like status, comments, and a timestamp to track when each action was taken.

### Expert 1: That makes sense. And since an action is performed by an employee and relates to a specific request, we can establish a one-to-many relationship between Employee and Action, as well as a one-to-many relationship between Request and Action.

### Expert 2: Agreed. And to make it easier to navigate the relationships, we can include reference attributes in the classes. For example, the Request class can have a customer attribute that refers to the associated customer, and the Action class can have request and employee attributes to establish the relationships.

### Expert 3: That sounds good. To summarize, we have the Customer, Request, Feedback, Employee, and Action classes. The Request and Feedback classes have a one-to-many relationship with the Customer class, while the Action class has a one-to-many relationship with both Request and Employee.

### Expert 1: Right. Now we should also consider additional attributes and methods for each class to capture more specific details and behaviors. But the overall structure seems to align with the requirements you provided.

### Expert 2: Agreed. Are there any specific behaviors or additional attributes we should consider for the classes, or anything else that needs clarification?

### Instructions: Here is one possible step-by-step solution for designing the class diagram:

1. Create the Customer class with the following attributes:
   - customerID: string
   - name: string
   - email: string
   - phone: string

2. Create the Request class with the following attributes:
   - requestID: string
   - customer: Customer                   // Reference to associated customer
   - requestText: string
   - submittedDate: date
   - resolved: boolean

3. Create the Feedback class with the following attributes:
   - feedbackID: string
   - customer: Customer                   // Reference to associated customer
   - feedbackText: string
   - submittedDate: date

4. Create the Employee class with the following attributes:
   - employeeID: string
   - name: string
   - role: string

5. Create the Action class with the following attributes:
   - actionID: string
   - request: Request                     // Reference to associated request
   - employee: Employee                   // Reference to associated employee
   - status: string
   - actionDate: date
   - comments: string

6. Establish relationships between classes:
   - (Customer) 1‑‑0..* (Request)
   - (Customer) 1‑‑0..* (Feedback)
   - (Request) 1‑‑0..* (Action)
   - (Employee) 1‑‑0..* (Action)

7. Add any additional attributes or methods needed to capture further details or behaviors of the classes, based on individual requirements and system functionality.

That completes the basic design for the class diagram. The experts can now proceed with implementing more specific functionalities and methods based on the requirements of efficiently managing customer requests and feedback within the system.

class Customer {
  - customerID: string
  - name: string
  - email: string
  - phone: string
}

class Request {
  - requestID: string
  - customer: Customer
  - requestText: string
  - submittedDate: Date
  - resolved: boolean
}

class Feedback {
  - feedbackID: string
  - customer: Customer
  - feedbackText: string
  - submittedDate: Date
}

class Employee {
  - employeeID: string
  - name: string
  - role: string
}

class Action {
  - actionID: string
  - request: Request
  - employee: Employee
  - status: string
  - actionDate: Date
  - comments: string
}

Customer "1-0..*" -- "1-0.." Request
Customer "1-0..*" -- "1-0.." Feedback
Request "1-0.." -- "1-0.." Action
Employee "1-0.." -- "1-0.." Action
