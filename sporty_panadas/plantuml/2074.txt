### Request: I would like to have a UML model for a web application where customers can browse and order products online, pay through their accounts, and receive notifications about the status of their orders.
### Expert 1: Okay, so the main functionality of this web application would be browsing and ordering products, customer account management, payment processing, and notifications about order status. 
### Expert 2: Right. Let's start by identifying the main classes we'll need in our UML diagram. We'll definitely need a "Product" class to represent the products available for purchase. It should have attributes like name, description, price, and maybe an image. And of course, methods for getting and setting those attributes.
### Expert 3: Agreed. We'll also need a "Customer" class to represent the customers using the web application. It should have attributes like name, email, and account balance. We'll also need a "Cart" class to keep track of the products a customer wants to buy.
### Expert 1: Absolutely. We should also include a "Order" class to represent a customer's finalized purchase. This class may contain attributes like order number, date, and status. And we'll need a way to associate each order with a customer using a price attribute for each individual product.Speaking of which, I think we will need a method to calculate the total price for an order.
### Expert 2: Good point. And since the customers will be paying through their accounts, we should have a "Payment" class that has attributes like payment method, amount, and date. This class should be associated with the Order class somehow.
### Expert 3: Right. I'm also thinking we'll need a "Notification" class to handle notifications about order status. For this class, we can keep it simple with attributes like content, date, status, and maybe a reference to the Order it belongs to.
### Expert 1: That sounds reasonable. What about the relationships between these classes? Any thoughts on how they would link together?
### Expert 2: Well, there's definitely an association between the Product and Cart classes. Each cart can contain multiple products, so we can model this as a one-to-many relationship.
### Expert 3: Agreed. And since each order is associated with one cart, we can also represent this as a one-to-one relationship between the Order and Cart classes.
### Expert 1: Makes sense. I also noticed that there will be an association between the Payment and Order classes. Each order will have one payment, but a payment can be associated with multiple orders if needed.
### Expert 2: Right. And finally, there's an association between the Customer and Order classes. A customer can have multiple orders, so we can represent this as a one-to-many relationship.
### Expert 3: Sounds good to me. Is there anything else we should consider before finalizing the diagram?
### Expert 1: Well, we might want to include methods in the classes to encapsulate behavior, such as adding a product to a cart or placing an order. Also, I'm thinking we probably need a few more attributes and methods, such as a method to calculate the discount applied to a product or to update the account balance after a payment.
### Expert 2: I agree. Adding those methods would certainly improve the usability and functionality of our UML model. Anything else we should discuss?
### Expert 3: Not that I can think of right now. Should we go ahead and draw up this UML diagram with the classes, attributes, and associations we discussed?
### Expert 1: That sounds like a good plan. Let's create the diagrams with all the necessary elements, including inheritance and any additional relationships we might have missed. We can always come back and refine it if we need to.

Conclusion:
In conclusion, these UML experts discussed the main classes required for a web application where customers can browse, order products, and manage their accounts online. They proposed classes such as Product, Customer, Cart, Order, Payment, and Notification. They discussed the attributes and methods that each class might have and considered relationships between the classes. They also discussed the need for additional attributes and methods to enhance the functionality of the application. The experts agreed to draw up a UML diagram, refining it as needed.
### Instructions: 1. Create a "Product" class with attributes such as name, description, price, and maybe an image.
2. Create a "Customer" class with attributes like name, email, and account balance.
3. Create a "Cart" class with an association to the "Product" class, representing a one-to-many relationship where a cart can contain multiple products.
4. Add methods to the "Product" class for getting and setting attributes, such as getName(), getDescription(), getPrice(), etc.
5. Create an "Order" class with attributes like order number, date, and status.
6. Create an association between the "Order" and "Cart" classes, representing a one-to-one relationship where each order is associated with one cart.
7. Create a modified association between the "Order" and the "Customer" classes, representing a one-to-many relationship where a customer can have multiple orders.
8. Add attributes to the "Order" class such as totalPrice to calculate the total price for an order.
9. Create a "Payment" class with attributes like payment method, amount, and date.
10. Create an association between the "Payment" and "Order" classes, representing a one-to-many relationship where an order can have one payment associated with it. This association is a modified version of the traditional UML association.
11. Create a "Notification" class with attributes like content, date, status, and a reference to the "Order" it belongs to.
12. Add methods to the classes for behaviors such as adding a product to a cart or placing an order.
13. Include additional methods in the classes for calculating discounts applied to products or updating the account balance after a payment.
14. Review the diagram for completeness and accuracy, ensuring that all required associations and attributes are present.
 

### PlantUML:
Filename: web_application.puml
@startuml

class Product {
  - name: String
  - description: String
  - price: double
  - image: String
  + getName(): String
  + getDescription(): String
  + getPrice(): double
  + setImage(image: String): void
}

class Customer {
  - name: String
  - email: String
  - accountBalance: double
}

class Cart {
  + products: Product[]
}

class Order {
  - orderNumber: int
  - date: Date
  - status: String
  - totalPrice: double
  + calculateTotalPrice(): double
}

class Payment {
  - paymentMethod: String
  - amount: double
  - date: Date
}

class Notification {
  - content: String
  - date: Date
  - status: String
  - order: Order
}

Cart "1" --> "0..*" Product

Order "1" --> "1" Cart
Order "1" --> "0..*" Payment
Order "0..*" --> "1" Customer

Payment --> Order

Notification --> "1" Order
