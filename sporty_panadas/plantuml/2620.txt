### Request: We're developing an app for tracking personal fitness goals and workouts, where users can log exercises, set goals, track progress, and connect with friends.
### Expert 1: So, our user wants an app for tracking personal fitness goals and workouts, right?

### Expert 2: That's correct. It seems like a standard fitness tracking app where users can log exercises, set goals, track progress, and connect with friends.

### Expert 3: We should start by capturing the main entities and relationships. We can have User, Exercise, Goal, Workout, and Friend entities. Relationships could include logging activities, setting goals, and tracking progress. Is that what you had in mind?

### Expert 1: Yes, we'll need to define the properties and behaviors of each entity. Let's sketch out the class diagram and then we can discuss the details for each entity.

### Expert 2: Right. Starting with the User entity, we should probably have attributes such as name, email, and password. We also might want methods for adding friends and accessing friend updates.

### Expert 3: Good point. We could have a Friend entity that has attributes like name and workout stats. We'll need to establish a many-to-many relationship between the User and Friend entities, so users can have multiple friends and friends can have multiple users.

### Expert 1: Agreed. And for managing exercises, should we have an Exercise entity with attributes like name, description, and intensity level?

### Expert 2: Yes, and we can create a many-to-many relationship between Exercise and User entities, so users can log multiple exercises and exercises can be logged by multiple users.

### Expert 3: Absolutely. Now, let's talk about goals. A Goal entity can have attributes like target weight, target daily steps, and target daily calorie intake. We should also consider having methods to track goal progress.

### Expert 1: I agree. And we should have a one-to-many relationship between User and Goal, so each user can have multiple goals.

### Expert 2: Sounds good. Just to clarify, when we talk about tracking progress, are we thinking of saving the start and end date for each workout and being able to calculate the progress made over a specific period of time?

### Expert 3: I think it makes sense to save the start and end date and calculate the progress. That way, we can allow users to filter and compare their progress for different time periods.

### Expert 1: That seems reasonable. Now, how about the Workout entity? We can include attributes like exercise, duration, and date/time. And for every workout, we could calculate key metrics like burned calories.

### Expert 2: Agreed. We might also want methods to retrieve the total duration and total burned calories for a specific period.

### Expert 3: True. We need to think about computational attributes carefully. Instead of directly saving an attribute "Age," would it make more sense to store the "Date of Birth" and have a method called "getAge"? Otherwise, we'll have to update it every year.

### Expert 1: That's a good point. By storing the date of birth, we can ensure that the age is always accurate without needing constant updates.

### Expert 2: It also prevents inconsistencies if new records are added without updating the age attribute. So, storing the date of birth and calculating the age on-demand is a better approach.

### Expert 3: Another consideration can be the pricing. Instead of saving a regular price and a discounted price, it might be better to save a price and a discount and have a method to calculate the discounted price when needed.

### Expert 1: I agree. This way, we only need to update the price and discount values, and the system will automatically calculate the discounted price. It's more flexible and avoids redundant data storage.

### Expert 2: Makes total sense. It simplifies maintenance and ensures consistent results when discounts change or new ones are added.

### Expert 3: Great. So, let's summarize what we have for the class diagram so far: User, Friend, Exercise, Goal, and Workout entities with the appropriate attributes and relationships. We also agreed on using computational attributes like getAge and getDiscountedPrice.  

### Expert 1: Yes, now that we have a solid understanding of the domain and requirements, we can proceed with finalizing the class diagram and start building the app based on it. It looks like we have a good plan in place.

### Expert 2: Indeed. By carefully designing the class diagram, we can ensure that the app satisfies the user's needs and is easier to maintain and extend in the future.

### Expert 3: Absolutely. Well, let's wrap up the diagram and get started. I'm looking forward to seeing this fitness tracking app take shape!
### Instructions: 1. Start by creating a Class Diagram file to work on.
2. Add a "User" class with the attributes "name," "email," and "password."
3. Add methods to the "User" class for adding friends and accessing friend updates.
4. Create a "Friend" class with attributes such as "name" and "workout stats."
5. Establish a many-to-many relationship between the "User" and "Friend" classes.
6. Add an "Exercise" class with attributes like "name," "description," and "intensity level."
7. Define a many-to-many relationship between the "Exercise" and "User" classes.
8. Create a "Goal" class and add attributes like "target weight," "target daily steps," and "target daily calorie intake."
9. Add methods to the "Goal" class to track goal progress.
10. Establish a one-to-many relationship between the "User" and "Goal" classes.
11. Create a "Workout" class with attributes such as "exercise," "duration," and "date/time."
12. Calculate key metrics like burned calories within the "Workout" class.
13. Define a one-to-many relationship between the "User" and "Workout" classes.
14. Finally, consider computational attributes like "getAge" based on the "Date of Birth" attribute instead of storing age and consider "getDiscountedPrice" based on a "price" attribute and a separate "discount" attribute for the comfortable recalculation of discounted price.

By following these steps, the experts will have a comprehensive and well-planned class diagram for the app, laying a solid foundation for the subsequent development process.

### PlantUML:
Filename: fitness_tracking_app.puml

@startuml
class User {
  - name: String
  - email: String
  - password: String
  + addFriend(): void
  + getFriendUpdates(): void
}

class Friend {
  - name: String
  - workoutStats: String
}

User "1" -> "M" Friend

class Exercise {
  - name: String
  - description: String
  - intensityLevel: String
}

User "M" <---> "M" Exercise

class Goal {
  - targetWeight: Double
  - targetDailySteps: Integer
  - targetDailyCalorieIntake: Integer
  + trackProgress(): void
}

User "1" *-- "M" Goal

class Workout {
  - exercise: Exercise
  - duration: Integer
  - dateTime: DateTime
  - burnedCalories: Integer
}

User "1" *-- "M" Workout
