### Request: We need an UML model for a booking system for a hotel that allows guests to search for available rooms, make reservations, receive confirmations, and pay online.
### Expert 1: So, we have a request to design a UML model for a hotel booking system. It should allow guests to search for available rooms, make reservations, receive confirmations, and pay online. 

### Expert 2: Alright. Let's start by identifying the main actors in this system. Obviously, we have the "Guest" who will be searching for rooms and making reservations.

### Expert 3: Agreed. We also have the "Hotel" as an actor who will manage the availability of rooms and confirm reservations. And finally, there's the "Payment Gateway" that will handle the online payments.

### Expert 1: Great, now let's move on to the classes. Immediately, I can think of the "Room" class which represents the rooms available in the hotel. It would have attributes like roomNumber, roomType, and capacity.

### Expert 2: Sounds good. We should also have a "Reservation" class to capture the information about a guest's reservation. This could include attributes like reservationNumber, check-in date, check-out date, and a reference to the guest.

### Expert 3: Right. And to connect the Reservation class with the Room class, we can add an association between them to represent that a room can have multiple reservations. We'll need to specify the multiplicity though.

### Expert 1: Agreed. What about the Confirmation? Should we create a separate class for it?

### Expert 2: Hmm, I think it's not necessary to have a separate class for Confirmation. We can instead have a flag within the Reservation class to indicate whether a confirmation has been sent.

### Expert 3: That makes sense. We can have a boolean attribute called "confirmed" in the Reservation class.

### Expert 1: Now, how can we incorporate the payment functionality?

### Expert 2: We should include a "Payment" class to represent a guest making a payment. It could have attributes like paymentID, amount, and status.

### Expert 3: And we can associate the Payment class with the Reservation class to represent that a payment is connected to a reservation.

### Expert 1: Agreed. Now, what about the search functionality?

### Expert 2: We could have a separate class called "RoomSearch" to encapsulate the searching logic. This class could include methods to search for available rooms based on specific criteria like a given check-in and check-out date.

### Expert 3: That's a good idea. We could add associations between the RoomSearch class and the Room class to represent the search results.

### Expert 1: Also, since we are designing an online system, maybe we should consider a possible integration with a payment gateway.

### Expert 2: Absolutely. We can add an association between the Payment class and the PaymentGateway actor to represent the communication between the two.

### Expert 3: Before we wrap up, should we think about potential additional classes for managing guest information or for logging system activities?

### Expert 1: Good point. We could add a "Guest" class to store guest information like name, email, and phone number. And maybe a "Logging" class to log system activities like reservations, payments, and errors.

### Expert 2: That sounds reasonable. With these classes in place, we should now check if there are any additional attributes or methods we need to consider.
### Instructions: 1. Identify the main actors in the system: Guest, Hotel, and Payment Gateway.
2. Create a class called "Room" with attributes: roomNumber, roomType, capacity.
3. Create a class called "Reservation" with attributes: reservationNumber, checkInDate, checkOutDate.
4. Add a boolean attribute "confirmed" to the Reservation class.
5. Create a class called "Payment" with attributes: paymentID, amount, status.
6. Establish an association between the Reservation class and the Room class.
   - Specify that a Room can have multiple Reservations (1 to many).
7. Establish an association between the Reservation class and the Payment class.
   - Specify that a Reservation can have a single Payment (1 to 1).
8. Create a class called "RoomSearch" to encapsulate the search functionality.
9. Add methods to the RoomSearch class for searching available rooms based on specified criteria (e.g., check-in and check-out dates).
10. Establish associations between the RoomSearch class and the Room class.
    - Specify that RoomSearch returns multiple Rooms (1 to many).
11. Add an association between the Payment class and the PaymentGateway actor.
12. Create a class called "Guest" with attributes: name, email, phone_number.
13. Create a class called "Logging" to log system activities.
14. Include methods in the Logging class for logging activities such as reservations, payments, and errors.
