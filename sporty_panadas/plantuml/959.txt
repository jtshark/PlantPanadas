### Request: My project is a mobile app that helps users track their water intake by setting daily goals, giving reminders, and providing progress updates.
### Expert 1: So, we need to design a UML class diagram for a mobile app that tracks water intake for users. Let's start by identifying the main classes and their attributes and behaviors.

### Expert 2: Agreed. One obvious class would be "User." It should have attributes like name, age, and gender. We can also add attributes like current daily water intake and daily goal.

### Expert 3: Yes, but I think instead of directly storing the current daily water intake attribute, we can save the number of glasses of water consumed throughout the day. That way, we can later calculate the actual intake and easily validate it against the goal.

### Expert 1: That makes sense. It also allows us to add a method, "getProgress," which can calculate and return the percentage of the daily goal achieved based on the number of glasses consumed.

### Expert 2: Good point. We can also include a method called "setGoal" in the User class, which sets the daily water intake goal for each user.

### Expert 3: To keep track of the reminder feature, we could introduce another class, "Reminder." It could have attributes like reminder time, frequency, and whether it has been triggered or not.

### Expert 1: That's a great addition! Having separate attributes for reminder time and frequency allows users to have flexibility in setting up reminders at different times and intervals throughout the day.

### Expert 2: We should also include a relationship between User and Reminder classes. Each user can have multiple reminders, and each reminder can be associated with only one user. So, it could be a one-to-many relationship.

### Expert 3: True, to represent the association between User and Reminder, we can use an arrow on the User class side indicating the aggregation relationship.

### Expert 1: Now, let's consider another class, "ProgressTracker." This class can have methods to calculate the average water intake for a group of users, the highest and lowest daily intakes, and so on.

### Expert 2: Agreed. We can also consider adding a class called "History" that tracks users' past water intake data. It could have attributes like date, time, and total water intake for the day.

### Expert 3: That's a good idea. By storing the data in a separate class, we can easily retrieve past user behavior and generate graphical representations of their progress over time.

### Expert 1: I think we've covered most of the major classes. Did we miss anything?

### Expert 2: One thing I would suggest is to have a separate class, such as "Notification," responsible for sending notifications to users when they haven't reached their daily goals or for any other relevant updates.

### Expert 3: That's a valid point. By having a separate class for notifications, it decouples the logic of sending notifications from the other classes, making the main classes more focused on their specific responsibilities.

### Expert 1: I think we have a good understanding of the classes and their relationships for this application. We can now move on to specifying the precise attributes and methods for each class.

### Expert 2: One thing I think we should do is seek clarification from the user about what constitutes a "glass" of water in the context of this app. Some people might drink water in different volumes, such as bottles or cups. Understanding this clarification will help us define the attributes and methods more precisely.

### Expert 3: Absolutely. Let's make a note to ask the user about the water volume clarification. We should also ask if there are any specific requirements for handling notifications, like types of notifications and when they should be triggered.

### Expert 1: Sounds good. Should we discuss how subclasses, such as "PremiumUser" or "GuestUser," fit into this class diagram as well?

### Expert 2: That's a good thought. We can handle different types of users as subclasses, which can inherit attributes and methods from the main "User" class. It could be a good way to encapsulate additional functionality or features specific to premium or guest users.

### Expert 1: Agreed. I think we have a lot to consider and clarify with the user before we finalize the UML class diagram. Shall we prepare our list of questions for the user and move forward from here?

### Expert 3: Definitely. Let's make sure we cover all our bases before we proceed.
### Instructions: Solution:

Step 1: Identify the main classes:
- User

Step 2: Define the attributes and behaviors for the User class:
- Attributes: name, age, gender, daily goal (in number of glasses)
- Behaviors: setGoal(), getCurrentDailyWaterIntake(), getProgress()

Step 3: Identify another class:
- Reminder

Step 4: Define the attributes and behaviors for the Reminder class:
- Attributes: reminder time, frequency, triggered
- Behaviors: None specified at this time

Step 5: Establish the relationship between User and Reminder classes:
- User has multiple reminders (one-to-many relationship)

Step 6: Introduce another class:
- ProgressTracker

Step 7: Define the attributes and behaviors for the ProgressTracker class:
- Attributes: None specified at this time
- Behaviors: calculate average intake for a group of users, find highest and lowest daily intakes

Step 8: Consider a class to track past data:
- History

Step 9: Define the attributes and behaviors for the History class:
- Attributes: date, time, total water intake for the day
- Behaviors: None specified at this time

Step 10: Introduce a class to handle notifications:
- Notification

Step 11: Define the attributes and behaviors for the Notification class:
- Attributes: None specified at this time
- Behaviors: send notifications to users

Step 12: Consider subclasses of User, such as PremiumUser and GuestUser:
- These subclasses can inherit attributes and behaviors from the User class
- Extra features specific to each subclass can be encapsulated here

Step 13: Seek clarifications from the user about:
- Clarification on the volume of a "glass" of water
- Specific notification requirements (types and triggers)

### PlantUML:
Filename: water_intake_tracking_app.puml

```
@startuml
class User {
  - name: String
  - age: int
  - gender: String
  - dailyGoal: int
  + setGoal(goal: int): void
  + getCurrentDailyWaterIntake(): int
  + getProgress(): float
}

class Reminder {
  - reminderTime: String
  - frequency: String
  - triggered: boolean
}

class ProgressTracker {
  + calculateAverageIntake(users: User[]): float
  + findHighestIntake(users: User[]): int
  + findLowestIntake(users: User[]): int
}

class History {
  - date: Date
  - time: Time
  - totalIntake: int
}

class Notification {
  + sendNotification(user: User, message: String): void
}

User "1" *-- "*" Reminder

User --> ProgressTracker
User --> Notification
ProgressTracker ..> User
Notification -- User

abstract class User {
  # name: String
  # age: int
  # gender: String
  # dailyGoal: int
  + setGoal(goal: int): void
  + getCurrentDailyWaterIntake(): int
  + getProgress(): float
}
