### Request: Our project involves building a system for managing online orders for a food delivery service, which includes a menu of available items, the ability for customers to customize orders, scheduling deliveries, and managing payment processing.
### Expert 1: So, let's start by discussing the main entities we'll include in our class diagram. Of course, we need a Customer class and an Order class. 

### Expert 2: Agreed. I think Customer should have attributes like customerID, name, email, and address. 

### Expert 3: And I suppose Order would need attributes like orderID, orderDate, and deliveryAddress. Also, a reference to the Customer who placed the order. 

### Expert 1: Yes, that makes sense. But what about the menu of available items? Should we have a separate class for that?

### Expert 3: Hmm, maybe we could add a MenuItem class. Each MenuItem object would have attributes such as name, description, and price.

### Expert 2: True, but we also need to allow customers to customize their orders, right? Should we have additional classes for that?

### Expert 1: We could approach it by having a base Item class and then deriving specific classes like CustomizableItem and NonCustomizableItem.

### Expert 3: Makes sense. A CustomizableItem would have attributes like size, toppings, and extras, while a NonCustomizableItem wouldn't have those attributes.

### Expert 2: I agree. But what about delivery scheduling? Should we have a DeliverySlot class to handle that?

### Expert 1: I think we can keep it simpler by just including a deliveryDate attribute in the Order class. The time slots can be managed separately.

### Expert 3: That sounds reasonable. And I suppose the Order class would also have associations with MenuItem or CustomizableItem to represent the items ordered?

### Expert 2: Right, so each Order object would maintain a list of MenuItems or CustomizableItems. We could use aggregation relationships for that.

### Expert 1: Exactly. And what about payment processing? Should we include a Payment class?

### Expert 3: I think it would be more appropriate to have a PaymentProcessor class that encapsulates the logic for handling payment transactions. The Order class could then have a reference to this class.

### Expert 2: Sounds good. But should we include attributes like subtotal, tax, and total in the Order class to keep track of the payment details?

### Expert 1: Those attributes are derived from the MenuItem or CustomizableItem prices, so there is no need to duplicate that information. Instead, we can have methods within the Order class that calculate those values based on the items ordered.
### Instructions: 1. Create a Customer class:
   - Add attributes: customerID (int), name (string), email (string), and address (string).

2. Create an Order class:
   - Add attributes: orderID (int), orderDate (date), and deliveryAddress (string).
   - Add association to the Customer class for the customer who placed the order.

3. Create a MenuItem class:
   - Add attributes: name (string), description (string), and price (float).

4. Derive a CustomizableItem class from MenuItem:
   - Add attributes specific to customization such as size (string), toppings (array[string]), and extras (array[string]).

5. Derive a NonCustomizableItem class from MenuItem.

6. Add an association between Order and MenuItem/CustomizableItem classes:
   - Order has an aggregation relationship with MenuItem/CustomizableItem to represent the items ordered.
   - Each Order object maintains a list of menu items.

7. Create a PaymentProcessor class.

8. Modify the Order class:
   - Add a reference to the PaymentProcessor class to handle payment processing.

9. Update the associations between classes:
   - Order has an dependency relationship with PaymentProcessor.

10. Implement methods within the Order class to calculate payment details:
    - Use methods to derive attributes like subtotal, tax, and total based on the items ordered and their prices.

11. Further implementation and refinement:
    - Add additional methods and functionality as per project requirements.

Note: It's important to continuously review and update the class diagram as you progress with code implementation to ensure the design accurately represents the system.

### PlantUML:
Filename: food_delivery.puml

```puml
@startuml

class Customer {
  - customerID: int
  - name: string
  - email: string
  - address: string
}

class Order {
  - orderID: int
  - orderDate: date
  - deliveryAddress: string
  - customer: Customer
}

class MenuItem {
  - name: string
  - description: string
  - price: float
}

class CustomizableItem {
  - size: string
  - toppings: string[]
  - extras: string[]
}

class NonCustomizableItem {
  // no additional attributes
}

class PaymentProcessor {
  // implementation details
}

Order o-* MenuItem
Order o-* CustomizableItem

Customer --> Order
Order --> PaymentProcessor
