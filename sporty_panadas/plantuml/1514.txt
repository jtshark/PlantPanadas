### Request: Our project is a social media platform that users can create an account and post photos, videos and text updates, while also being able to follow and interact with other users' content.
### Expert 1: So our user wants to build a social media platform that allows users to create an account, post multimedia content, and interact with each other. I think we can start by modeling the basic user functionalities.

### Expert 2: Absolutely. We'll need a User class to represent the users of the platform. It should have attributes like username, email, and password for account login purposes.

### Expert 3: Agreed. Additionally, we'll need to include a couple of operations for functionalities such as creating a post, liking or commenting on posts, and following or unfollowing other users.

### Expert 1: Right. For the features you mentioned, we can have methods like createPost(), likePost(), comment(), followUser(), and unfollowUser() in the User class. These methods would handle the respective actions.

### Expert 2: Sounds good so far. Should we also establish a Post class to represent the multimedia content that users can share?

### Expert 3: Yes, that would be a good idea. The Post class can have attributes like content, media (to store the photo or video), timestamp (to keep track of when it was posted), and perhaps a unique ID for easy referencing.

### Expert 1: Agreed. We should also consider a relationship between the User and Post classes. Each user can have multiple posts, so we can associate a one-to-many relationship between User and Post.

### Expert 2: Definitely. We can express this association in our class diagram using a simple navigable association from User to Post, indicating that a User can post multiple Post objects.

### Expert 3: While we construct the class diagram, I'm curious about how we would incorporate features like follows and likes. Would a User have separate associations for those?

### Expert 1: That's a good point. Rather than duplicating the association, we can utilize a separate Follow and Like class to represent those interactions. For example, a Follow class can have attributes like follower and followee, marking the followers and the users being followed. Similarly, a Like class can track the user who liked the post and the relevant post.

### Expert 2: And to establish these associations, we would use navigable associations between User and Follow, as well as between User and Like classes. This way, we can indicate that a User can have multiple Follow and Like instances.

### Expert 3: Making use of separate classes certainly adds clarity to our class diagram. It also allows us to incorporate additional attributes and methods specific to those interactions in Follow and Like.

### Expert 1: Agreed. By having these separate classes, it becomes easier to track and manage those interactions on the platform. It also consolidates the logic and responsibilities within our class structure.

### Expert 2: Absolutely. Plus, if additional functionality needs to be added in the future, it can be extended more easily without making significant changes to the existing classes.

### Expert 3: I believe this approach is efficient and robust. It aligns well with common practices employed in various social media platforms.

### Expert 1: I think we've made good progress. Let's summarize: 

- We have a User class with attributes for login purposes.
- We have a Post class representing multimedia content, with attributes like media and timestamp.
- We use separate Follow and Like classes to track interactions, avoiding duplication of associations.
- We have appropriat
### Instructions: Step-by-Step Guide for Class Diagram Design:

1. Start by creating a class named "User" with the following attributes:
- username: String
- email: String
- password: String

2. Add the following methods to the User class:
- createPost(content: String, media: Media, timestamp: Timestamp): void
- likePost(post: Post): void
- comment(post: Post, text: String): void
- followUser(user: User): void
- unfollowUser(user: User): void

3. Create a class named "Post" with the following attributes:
- content: String
- media: Media
- timestamp: Timestamp
- id: String

4. Create an association between the User and Post classes:
- User 1..* --- 0..1 Post

5. Create a separate class named "Follow" with the following attributes:
- follower: User
- followee: User

6. Create an association between the User and Follow classes:
- User 1..* --- 0..* Follow (follower)
- User 1..* --- 0..* Follow (followee)

7. Create a separate class named "Like" with the following attributes:
- user: User
- post: Post

8. Create an association between the User and Like classes:
- User 1..* --- 0..* Like (user)
- Post 1..* --- 0..* Like (post)

9. (Optional) Create classes to represent attributes mentioned in steps 2, 3, and 4:
- Media (properties based on application requirements)
- Timestamp (properties based on application requirements)

You can repeat steps 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, and 8 as needed based on the application's additional functionalities or specific requirements.

Note: The class diagram design outlined above assumes a basic implementation. Depending on the complexity and desired functionalities of the application, more classes and relationships may be necessary.


### PlantUML:
Filename: social_media_platform.puml
@startuml

class User {
  - username: String
  - email: String
  - password: String
  + createPost(content: String, media: Media, timestamp: Timestamp): void
  + likePost(post: Post): void
  + comment(post: Post, text: String): void
  + followUser(user: User): void
  + unfollowUser(user: User): void
}

class Post {
  - content: String
  - media: Media
  - timestamp: Timestamp
  - id: String
}

class Follow {
  - follower: User
  - followee: User
}

class Like {
  - user: User
  - post: Post
}

User -- Post
User "1" -- "0..*" Follow : follower
User "1" -- "0..*" Follow : followee
User "1" -- "0..*" Like : user
Post "1" -- "0..*" Like : post

class Media {
    // properties based on application requirements
}

class Timestamp {
    // properties based on application requirements
}
