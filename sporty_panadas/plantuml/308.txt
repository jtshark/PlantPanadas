### Request: Our project is to create a mobile app where users can enter their fitness goals and track their workouts. The app should also allow for social networking features like adding friends, sharing progress and creating shareable workout routines.
### Expert 1: So it looks like we need to design a UML class diagram for a fitness tracking mobile app with social networking features. Let's start by identifying the main entities or classes that we will need. We can then think about their attributes and relationships.

### Expert 2: Yes, that's a good approach. Since the main focus of this app is fitness tracking, we should definitely have a "User" class. We can also have classes like "Workout", "FitnessGoal", "Routine", and "Friend". Are there any other classes that you think we should consider?

### Expert 3: I think we also need a "Progress" class to track the user's advancement towards their fitness goals. And perhaps a "Share" class to handle the sharing of progress and workout routines with friends.

### Expert 1: That's a good point. Let's consider the attributes for these classes. For the "User" class, we might need attributes like "name", "age", "gender", and "email". What do you think?

### Expert 2: Agreed. We should also include attributes like "weight" and "height" for tracking the user's physical characteristics. And since this is a mobile app, we might want to store the user's location as well.

### Expert 3: I also think we should consider an attribute for storing the user's friends. We can use an ArrayList or another collection to store the friend objects.

### Expert 1: Great suggestion. Now, for the "Workout" class, we can have attributes like "name", "duration", and "caloriesBurned".

### Expert 2: We'll also need a way to associate workouts with users. Should we add a reference to the "User" class in the "Workout" class and vice versa?

### Expert 3: Yes, I think that would make sense. Users will have multiple workouts, and each workout will belong to a specific user.

### Expert 1: Good point. Now, let's consider the "FitnessGoal" class. What attributes do you think we should include?

### Expert 2: We might want to include attributes like "goalType" to specify the type of fitness goal (e.g., weight loss, muscle gain), and "targetWeight" or "targetBodyfat" to define the user's desired outcome.

### Expert 3: I agree, and we could also include an attribute like "progress" to track how much the user has achieved towards their goal.

### Expert 1: Those are great suggestions. Now, how about the "Routine" class? Any suggestions for its attributes?

### Expert 2: We should consider including attributes like "name", "description", and maybe "difficulty level" of the routine. Additionally, we may want a way to associate routines with users, just like with workouts.

### Expert 3: Agreed. We can then have a collection of routines in the "User" class to store the ones created by that user.

### Expert 1: Lastly, let's think about the "Friend" class. What attributes should we include?

### Expert 2: We should definitely have an attribute to store the friend's name and maybe their profile picture. Additionally, we might want to have a reference to the "User" class in the "Friend" class to establish the relationship between friends.

### Expert 3: I think we may also want to keep track of the friend's progress in the app. We could add an attribute like "progress" to the "Friend" class as well.

### Expert 1: That sounds good. Now, let's summarize what we have so far:

### Instructions: 1. Create a new "User" class with attributes such as "name", "age", "gender", "email", "weight", "height", and "location".
2. Create a new "Workout" class with attributes like "name", "duration", and "caloriesBurned".
3. Add a reference to the "User" class in the "Workout" class to establish an association between them.
4. Create a new "FitnessGoal" class with attributes such as "goalType", "targetWeight", "targetBodyfat", and "progress".
5. Add a reference to the "User" class in the "FitnessGoal" class to establish an association between them.
6. Create a new "Routine" class with attributes like "name", "description", and "difficulty level".
7. Add a reference to the "User" class in the "Routine" class to establish an association between them.
8. Create a new "Friend" class with attributes for "name" and "profilePicture".
9. Add a reference to the "User" class in the "Friend" class to establish an association between them.
10. Add an ArrayList or another collection attribute in the "User" class to store instances of the "Friend" class.
