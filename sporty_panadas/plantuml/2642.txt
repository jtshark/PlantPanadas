### Request: We want to develop a mobile app for a camping trip planner, that allows users to search for campsites based on location and amenities, as well as create and share camping itineraries with others.
### Expert 1: So, we need to design a class diagram for a camping trip planner mobile app. I think we should start by identifying the main entities in this system. Any suggestions?

### Expert 2: Well, based on the user request, the main entities are users, campsites, and itineraries.

### Expert 3: That makes sense. We could also include separate entities for amenities and locations. Users can search for campsites based on amenities and locations.

### Expert 1: Agreed. So, we'll have User, Campsite, Itinerary, Location, and Amenity as our main entities. Now, what attributes and methods do we need for each of these entities?

### Expert 2: For User, we'll need attributes like name, email, and password for authentication purposes. It might be useful to include methods for creating and updating the user's profile.

### Expert 3: Yes, and for Campsite, we could have attributes like name, location, amenities, and availability. We'll need a method to check if a campsite is available on a specific date.

### Expert 1: That's a good start. Now, let's think about the Itinerary entity. Besides a unique identifier, it would be helpful to store the user who created it and the campsites included in the itinerary.

### Expert 3: We could also add the start and end dates of the itinerary. And we'll need methods to add campsites, remove campsites, and calculate the duration of the itinerary.

### Expert 2: Additionally, we may want to include a shareability feature for itineraries. So, we could add an attribute to indicate if an itinerary is public or private.

### Expert 1: Great idea. Now, for the Location entity, we primarily need attributes like name, latitude, and longitude. We can use these attributes to search for campsites.

### Expert 3: I agree. Lastly, for the Amenity entity, we just need a name attribute to represent different amenities offered by each campsite.

### Expert 2: Sounds good. Do we have enough information to proceed, or do we need to seek clarification from the user?

### Expert 1: Yes, I think we're on the right track. But I have one question. How would the user search for campsites based on amenities? Do they select specific amenities or is it more of a keyword search?


### Instructions: Step-by-step solution:
1. Create a class named "User" with attributes:
   - name: string
   - email: string
   - password: string  

2. Create a class named "Campsite" with attributes:
   - name: string
   - location: string
   - availability: boolean

3. Create a class named "Itinerary" with attributes:
   - id: int (auto-generated)
   - startDate: date
   - endDate: date
   - isPublic: boolean (default value is false)

4. Create a class named "Location" with attributes:
   - name: string
   - latitude: double
   - longitude: double

5. Create a class named "Amenity" with attributes:
   - name: string

6. Add methods to the "User" class:
    - createUser(name: string, email: string, password: string): User
    - updateUser(name: string, email: string, password: string): void

7. Add methods to the "Campsite" class:
   - addAmenity(amenity: Amenity): void
   - removeAmenity(amenity: Amenity): void

8. Add methods to the "Itinerary" class:
   - addCampsite(campsite: Campsite): void
   - removeCampsite(campsite: Campsite): void
   - calculateDuration(): int

9. Create associations between the classes:
    - User owns multiple Itineraries (one-to-many relationship)
    - Itinerary includes multiple Campsites (one-to-many relationship)
    - Campsite includes multiple Amenities (many-to-many relationship)
    - Campsite is associated with a Location (one-to-one relationship)

10. Define cardinalities for the associations:
    - User (1) owns Itinerary (*)
    - Itinerary (1) includes Campsite (*)
    - Campsite (*) includes Amenity (*)
    - Campsite (1) is associated with Location (1)

11. Finalize the class diagram with all the defined classes, attributes, methods, and associations.
    
(Note: The UML class diagram can be created using software like Visual Paradigm, Lucidchart, etc.)

### PlantUML:
Filename: camping_trip_planner.puml

```
@startuml

class User {
    - name: string
    - email: string
    - password: string
    + createUser(name: string, email: string, password: string): User
    + updateUser(name: string, email: string, password: string): void
}

class Campsite {
    - name: string
    - location: string
    - availability: boolean
    + addAmenity(amenity: Amenity): void
    + removeAmenity(amenity: Amenity): void
}

class Itinerary {
    - id: int
    - startDate: date
    - endDate: date
    - isPublic: boolean
    + addCampsite(campsite: Campsite): void
    + removeCampsite(campsite: Campsite): void
    + calculateDuration(): int
}

class Location {
    - name: string
    - latitude: double
    - longitu﻿de: double
}

class Amenity {
    - name: string
}

User "1" --> "*" Itinerary
Itinerary "1" --> "*" Ca﻿mpsite
Campsite "*..*" --> "*..*" Amenity
Campsite "1" --> "1" Location
