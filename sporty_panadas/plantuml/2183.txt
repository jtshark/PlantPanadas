### Request: For our project, we want to build a website where people can search for and buy different types of sportswear, as well as create their own accounts to save their favorite items and get recommendations based on their interests.
### Expert 1: So it seems like we have a clear user request for a sportswear shopping website. To start off with, we need to think about the core functionality for this system. Any suggestions?

### Expert 2: I think the most essential functionality would be the ability for users to search and buy different types of sportswear. We should have a "Product" class and include attributes like name, brand, price, and size.

### Expert 3: Agreed, but we also need to consider feature customization for users. They should have the ability to create their own accounts and save their favorite items. We can add a "User" class, which would have attributes like name, email, username, and password.

### Expert 1: Yes, great points. Additionally, we could use the user's interests to provide them with recommendations. For this, we'll need an "Interest" class that contains the user's preferred sport or athletic activity. We can then relate this class with the "User" class.

### Expert 2: That's a good idea. Now, what about the user's shopping history? Should we include a class for that too?

### Expert 3: I don't think we necessarily need a separate class for that. We can simply include a list of past purchases as an attribute in the "User" class. It would hold the products they have bought previously. We can also include methods like "getShoppingHistory()" to retrieve this information.

### Expert 1: Makes sense. How about allowing users to save items for later without purchasing them? Similar to a wishlist or favorites functionality.

### Expert 2: Right, we can include a "Wishlist" class that holds a list of products the user wants to remember or maybe purchase in the future. This class should be related to the "User" class, representing the idea that a user can have multiple saved products in their wishlist.

### Expert 3: Agreed. And since users will be searching for sportswear, we should incorporate a "Search" class to handle queries made by users and retrieve the appropriate results.

### Expert 1: That sounds good. We'll need a dependency between the "Search" class and both the "Product" and "User" classes. Also, let's not forget to include navigation functionality. We can create a basic "Navigation" class to represent the website menu and provide methods for navigating to different sections of the website.

### Expert 2: Excellent! I believe that covers the core features the user requested. While developing the website, we can add more functionality and classes if needed.

### Expert 3: Agreed. It's always better to start with the essential features and then expand as needed. So, with the current design, we should be able to meet the user's requirements and create a reliable and user-friendly sportswear shopping website.

### Expert 1: Absolutely, let's document this discussion and provide the user with a well-structured UML class diagram that encompasses all these features and relationships we discussed.

### Expert 2: Sounds like a plan. Let's get started on creating that diagram.
### Instructions: Step-by-step solution for designing the class diagram:
1. Create a "Product" class with attributes such as name, brand, price, and size.
2. Create a "User" class with attributes like name, email, username, and password.
3. Create a "Interest" class to represent the user's preferred sport or athletic activity.
4. Associate the "User" class with the "Interest" class to establish the user's interests.
5. Add a method "getShoppingHistory()" to the "User" class that retrieves the user's past purchases.
6. Create a "Wishlist" class to hold a list of products the user wants to save or purchase later.
7. Establish a relationship between the "Wishlist" and "Product" classes to represent saved items.
8. Implement a "Search" class to handle user queries and retrieve matching results.
9. Establish dependencies between the "Search" class, "Product" class, and "User" class for searching functionality.
10. Create a "Navigation" class to represent website navigation and enable access to different sections.
11. Document the entire design in a UML class diagram, including classes, associations, and attributes.
