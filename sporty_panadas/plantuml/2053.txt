### Request: We need an UML model for a website that lets people save and create various appointment types and reminder settings, while also enabling them to share these with other users they select.
### Expert 1: So, for this website, we need to design a UML class diagram to capture the different appointment types and reminder settings. Additionally, we need to incorporate a feature that allows users to share their appointments with selected users. Is that correct?

### Expert 2: Yes, that's right. We'll also need to consider how users can create and save different types of appointments. Should we have a specific class for appointment types?

### Expert 3: Yes, I think it would be a good idea to have a separate class for appointment types. This way, we can easily add and manage different types in the future.

### Expert 1: Agreed. I suggest we have a "Appointment" class as the main class to represent each individual appointment. Within this class, we can include attributes such as "title", "description", "time", "date", and "participant" to capture the necessary information.

### Expert 2: That works. But we should also consider including a separate class for reminder settings. This way, we can customize the reminder settings for each appointment.

### Expert 1: Good point. So, we could have a "ReminderSettings" class with attributes like "reminderTime" and "notificationMethod". These attributes will help users define their preferred time for reminders and the method they prefer to receive the notifications.

### Expert 3: Additionally, since users can share their appointments with selected users, we could create a "User" class to represent individual users in the system. We can then add a relationship to indicate which users are involved in each appointment.

### Expert 1: That's true. And to capture the sharing feature, we could add an association between the "Appointment" and "User" classes, specifying whether a particular user has permission to access a specific appointment.

### Expert 2: Yes, but let's keep in mind that users can select multiple users to share their appointments with. We need to reflect this correctly in our model.

### Expert 3: Correct. We can represent this by adding a multivalued attribute to the association between "Appointment" and "User", indicating which users have access to the appointment.

### Expert 1: Great suggestion. We should also include methods in our classes to allow users to create, update, and delete appointments, as well as manage reminder settings, and share appointments with other users.

### Expert 2: Absolutely. By including these essential methods, we'll ensure that the functionality of the website covers all the required features.

### Expert 3: Regarding the reminder settings, do we need to save any additional information apart from the time and the notification method? For instance, should we store if the user wants recurring reminders for the appointment?

### Expert 1: That's a good point. To handle recurring reminders, we could add an attribute to the "ReminderSettings" class representing the recurrence pattern, such as "daily", "weekly", or "monthly".

### Expert 2: Makes sense. However, instead of directly storing the age of the users, we could save their date of birth as one of the attributes and add a method to calculate the age dynamically whenever needed.

### Expert 3: That's a great idea. This way, we don't have to worry about keeping the age attribute up-to-date and accurate within our model. Calculating it based on the date of birth when required is much more logical.

### Expert 1: Another consideration we should keep in mind is regarding the appointment types. Instead of creating separate classes for each type, we could potentially have an attribute within the "Appointment" class called "appointmentType" with a controlled vocabulary or enumerated data type.

### Expert 2: I agree. This way, we can easily manage and update the available appointment types without having to modify the structure of our class diagram every time a new appointment type is added.

### Expert 3: Additionally, we should consider if there will be any discount feature for certain types of appointments. Instead of directly storing the discounted price, we can save the actual price in the "Appointment" class and include a separate class representing a discount, along with a method to calculate the discounted price as needed.

### Expert 1: That's a clever idea. By separating the concepts of price and discount, we can maintain flexibility in handling discounts. It allows us to change the discount strategy easily without modifying the core attributes of the "Appointment" class.

### Expert 2: Agreed. This modeling approach aligns with standard software development principles, promoting encapsulation and separation of concerns within our system.

### Expert 1: Overall, I believe we have covered the essential aspects of designing the UML class diagram for this website. Is there anything else we need to consider or clarify?

### Expert 3: Just to be clear, do we need to incorporate any time zone handling or location-based features, considering that this website might have users from different geographic regions?

### Expert 1: That's a good point. It would be helpful to seek clarification from the user regarding their expectations on time zone handling and any other location-related considerations.

### Instructions: 1. Create a "User" class with attributes like "username", "password", "email", "dateOfBirth".
2. Add a method in the "User" class to calculate the age based on the date of birth.
3. Create an "Appointment" class with attributes like "title", "description", "time", "date".
4. Add an attribute "appointmentType" to the "Appointment" class that captures different appointment types using a controlled vocabulary or enumerated data type.
5. Add a separate "AppointmentType" class with attributes like "typeId", "typeName", and any other necessary attributes to manage different appointment types in the future.
6. Create a "ReminderSettings" class with attributes like "reminderTime", "notificationMethod", "recurrencePattern" to handle reminders for appointments.
7. Add an attribute such as "recurrencePattern" to the "ReminderSettings" class for handling recurring reminders (options like "daily", "weekly", "monthly").
8. Create an "AccessPermission" class to represent the permission for users to access specific appointments.
9. Add a multivalued attribute within the association between "Appointment" and "User" classes to capture which users have access to the appointment through the "AccessPermission" class.
10. Include methods in the "Appointment" class to create, update, and delete appointments.
11. Include methods in the "ReminderSettings" class to manage the reminder settings.
12. Add a separate "Discount" class with attributes like "discountId", "discountType", "amount" to handle discounts for appointments.
13. Use a method in the "Discount" class to calculate the discounted price based on the actual price stored in the "Appointment" class.
14. Include methods in the "Appointment" class to handle the use of discounts while calculating prices.
15. Ensure appropriate associations are defined among the classes to capture the relationships between "Appointment", "User", "ReminderSettings", "AccessPermission", and "Discount".
16. Review and modify the class diagram to accommodate any additional features or user requirements, ensuring clarity and consistency in the model.
17. Communicate the final UML class diagram to the development team for implementation.

### PlantUML:
Filename: website_appointment.puml

```plantuml
@startuml

class User {
  - username: String
  - password: String
  - email: String
  - dateOfBirth: Date
  + calculateAge(): int
}

class Appointment {
  - title: String
  - description: String
  - time: Time
  - date: Date
  - appointmentType: AppointmentType
  + createAppointment()
  + updateAppointment()
  + deleteAppointment()
}

class ReminderSettings {
  - reminderTime: Time
  - notificationMethod: String
  - recurrencePattern: String
  + manageReminderSettings()
}

class AppointmentType {
  - id: int
  - name: String
}

class AccessPermission {
}

class Discount {
  - id: int
  - type: String
  - amount: double
  + calculateDiscountedPrice(price: double): double
}

User --{ Appointment
Appointment *-- AppointmentType
Appointment o-- ReminderSettings
ReminderSettings *-- AccessPermission
Appointment *.. Discount

Please note that this is a basic model, and there may be additional attributes, associations, or methods that need to be added based on specific requirements and business logic. The UML Class Diagram should serve as a starting point and can be further refined during the development phase.
