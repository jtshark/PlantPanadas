### Request: Our project is to create a mobile app that allows users to map out their running route, track their progress, and share their achievements on social media.
### Expert 1: So, for this mobile app project, we need to design a UML class diagram that captures the essence of mapping running routes, tracking progress, and sharing achievements. Can we start by identifying the main entities involved?

### Expert 2: Absolutely. Let's begin by brainstorming some potential classes related to mapping running routes. I think we'll need a class for the user's profile to manage their personal information.

### Expert 3: Agreed. We can also include a class for the running route itself, which could store details such as the distance, duration, and elevation.

### Expert 1: Good points. Additionally, since mapping may involve geographical coordinates, we should consider having a class to handle coordinates. This class can be used to locate the starting point, endpoints, and any points of interest along the running route.

### Expert 2: We'll also need a class for the user's progress so that we can keep track of the distance they've covered, the time taken, and other relevant statistics. How about a class called "RunProgress"?

### Expert 3: That sounds reasonable. In addition, we should probably have a class for achievements, which can represent milestones or goals that users can reach or unlock, like running a certain distance or completing a specific number of runs.

### Expert 1: Absolutely. Are there any other relevant classes that come to mind?

### Expert 2: We might also want to include a class for social media connections. This class can handle communication with social media platforms, allowing users to share their achievements directly.

### Expert 3: Good suggestion. And while we're at it, let's also add a class for a running group or club. This class would facilitate the creation and management of running groups where users can join and participate in group challenges.

### Expert 1: Great addition. I think we have a solid starting point for our UML class diagram. Now it's time to define the relationships and attributes for these classes.
### Instructions: Step-by-step solution for designing the UML class diagram:

1. Create a class called "UserProfile" with attributes like username, email, password, and fitness goals.
2. Add a class called "RunningRoute" with attributes such as distance, duration, elevation, and waypoints (represented by an instance of the "Coordinates" class).
3. Define a class called "Coordinates" with attributes for latitude and longitude.
4. Create a class called "RunProgress" with attributes for distanceCovered, timeElapsed, and other relevant statistics.
5. Add a class called "Achievement" with attributes like name, description, and category.
6. Create a class called "SocialMediaConnection" to handle interactions with social media platforms, with attributes such as API keys and tokens.
7. Add a class called "RunningGroup" with attributes like group name, member count, and a list of members.
8. Create associations between the classes:
    - UserProfile should have a "has" association with RunProgress to track the user's progress.
    - UserProfile should also have a "has" association with PlanningRoute to keep track of the routes planned by the user.
    - UserProfile should have a "has" association with SocialMediaConnection for sharing achievements on social media.
    - UserProfile should have a "belongs to" association with RunningGroup, indicating the user's membership in a running group.
    - RunningRoute should have a "has-a" association with RunProgress to associate progress with each route.
    - Achievement should have a "completed by" association with UserProfile to indicate which users achieved it.
    - RunningGroup should have a "has-a" association with UserProfile to maintain the list of members.
      appropriate multiplicity required(jus so it accompanies the progression as normally depicted by using * instead of integer)

9. Consider implementing further associations, such as collaborations were one profile runs diffent routes offered by different groups and achievements offered to a subset(users) )

10. Lastly, review the class diagram for any additional relationships or attributes needed for a comprehensive and accurate representation of the mobile app.
