### Request: My project is to design a mobile app for a food delivery service that allows customers to choose their meals, pay securely through the app, and track their orders in real time.
### Expert 1: So, we are designing a UML class diagram for a food delivery app. I think we should start by identifying the main classes in our system. Any ideas?

### Expert 2: Yes, I think we definitely need a "Customer" class to represent the app users. It should have attributes like name, address, phone number, and email.

### Expert 3: Agreed. Additionally, we should have a "Meal" class to represent the different food items available for delivery. This class could have attributes like name, description, price, and maybe even an image.

### Expert 1: Great! We should also include a "Restaurant" class since customers need to choose meals from specific restaurants. It could have attributes like name, address, and maybe a rating.

### Expert 2: That makes sense. We also need a class to represent customer orders. What should we call it?

### Expert 3: How about "Order"? This class could have attributes like order ID, customer referenced from the Customer class, selected meals (referenced from the Meal class), order status, and order timestamp.

### Expert 1: That sounds good. Now, to handle secure payments, we should include a class to represent the payment process. Any suggestions?

### Expert 2: We can call it "Payment." It would have attributes such as payment ID, total amount, and a reference to the customer who made the payment.

### Expert 3: Right. And we should connect the Payment class to the Order class, as it represents the payment made for a specific order.

### Expert 1: Agreed. Now that we have the basic classes, we need to think about ordering and delivering the meals. Should we have a separate class for delivery?

### Expert 2: Yes, we could have a "Delivery" class. It would have attributes like delivery ID, delivery person's details, delivery status, and maybe the estimated delivery time.

### Expert 3: Sounds good. We should link the Delivery class to the Order class to indicate which order is being delivered.

### Expert 1: I think we're making good progress, but there are still a few details that need clarification. How do we plan to track orders in real time?

### Expert 2: That's an important feature. Perhaps we could have a method in the Order class to update the order status whenever there's a change, and the app can then fetch and display that status in real time.

### Expert 3: That would work, along with some kind of notification system to notify the customer of changes in the order status.

### Expert 1: Absolutely. Additionally, should we consider having separate classes for different types of meals, like main course, appetizers, desserts, etc.?

### Expert 2: It depends on how our app is organized. If we think it will make it easier for customers to browse and order, then having separate classes for different meal types might be a good idea.

### Expert 3: Right. We should keep in mind that having separate classes may allow us to add specific attributes or methods that only apply to certain types of meals.

### Expert 1: True. It seems like we've covered most of the important aspects of the system, but there might be more details that we missed or didn't consider. Should we reach out to the user for further clarification?

### Expert 2: Good point. Let's prepare a list of questions related to specific scenarios or functionalities before we present our initial design to the user.

### Expert 3: Yes, that way we can make sure we have a comprehensive understanding of the user's requirements and can refine our UML class diagram accordingly.

### Expert 1: Agreed. Let's start by writing down what we have so far, and then prepare our questions to seek clarifications.
### Instructions: Here's a step-by-step solution for designing the class diagram for the food delivery app:

1. Create a "Customer" class with attributes like name, address, phone number, and email.
2. Create a "Meal" class with attributes like name, description, price, and image.
3. Create a "Restaurant" class with attributes like name, address, and rating.
4. Create an "Order" class with attributes like order ID, customer reference (from Customer class), selected meals references (from Meal class), order status, and order timestamp.
5. Create a "Payment" class with attributes like payment ID, total amount, and customer reference (from Customer class).
6. Create a "Delivery" class with attributes like delivery ID, delivery person details, delivery status, and estimated delivery time.
7. Connect the "Payment" class to the "Order" class using an association to indicate the payment made for a specific order.
8. Connect the "Delivery" class to the "Order" class using an association to indicate which order is being delivered.
9. Create methods in the "Order" class to update the order status and a notification system to notify the customer of any changes.
10. Optional: If it aligns with the organization of the app, consider creating subclasses of the "Meal" class for different types (e.g., main course, appetizers, desserts) with additional specific attributes or methods.

Remember to seek clarifications from the user and modify the class diagram accordingly for better understanding of requirements.


### PlantUML:
Filename: food_delivery_app_class_diagram.puml
```
@startuml

class Customer {
  - name: String
  - address: String
  - phone_number: String
  - email: String
}

class Meal {
  - name: String
  - description: String
  - price: Float
  - image: Image
}

class Restaurant {
  - name: String
  - address: String
  - rating: Float
}

class Order {
  - order_id: String
  - customer: Customer
  - selected_meals: Set<Meal>
  - order_status: String
  - order_timestamp: DateTime
  + update_order_status(): void
}

class Payment {
  - payment_id: String
  - total_amount: Float
  - customer: Customer
}

class Delivery {
  - delivery_id: String
  - delivery_person_details: Person
  - delivery_status: String
  - estimated_delivery_time: DateTime
}

Order "1" --> "0..*" Meal
Order "1" --> "1" Customer
Order "1" -*> "1" Payment
Order "1" --> "0..1" Delivery
