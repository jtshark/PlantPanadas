### Request: Create a website to sell handmade crafts where customers can browse products, create a user account, place orders, while the business owner manage product listings, order management, and customer support.
### Expert 1: So, we've been asked to design a UML class diagram for a website that sells handmade crafts. I think we should start by identifying the main actors involved in this system.

### Expert 2: Absolutely! We have the Customer, who can browse products, create an account, and place orders. The Business Owner, on the other hand, needs to manage product listings, order management, and customer support.

### Expert 3: Good start. Now we can focus on identifying the main classes that make up our system. How about we start with the Customer class? What attributes and operations do you think we should include?

### Expert 1: Well, we definitely need attributes like name, email, and address to identify the customer. Also, it might be a good idea to have a balance attribute to keep track of their account balance.

### Expert 2: That sounds reasonable. For the operations, we should include methods like browseProducts(), createAccount(), placeOrder(), and perhaps a getOrders() method to retrieve the customer's order history.

### Expert 3: Great suggestions! Now let's move on to the Business Owner class. Similarly, what attributes and operations come to mind for this class?

### Expert 1: The Business Owner needs to manage product listings, so we should include attributes such as productID, productName, price, and maybe even a quantityAvailable. Additionally, it would be helpful to have attributes for order tracking and customer support.

### Expert 2: I agree. For the operations, we could include methods like manageListings(), trackOrders(), and handleCustomerSupport().

### Expert 3: Good choices! Now, for the orders themselves, we might need another class. Any suggestions?

### Expert 1: Yes, I suggest we have an Order class. This class should include attributes such as orderID, datePlaced, productsOrdered, and maybe even a totalCost attribute. We should also include methods like cancelOrder() and calculateTotalCost().

### Expert 2: That sounds sensible. Including the productsOrdered attribute is important as it allows us to have multiple products associated with a single order.

### Expert 3: Absolutely. Now, let's consider product listings. Should we have a class to represent this aspect?

### Expert 1: Yes, I believe it would be beneficial to have a ProductListing class. This class could contain attributes like productID, productName, description, price, and more. We could also include a method to retrieve the available quantity of a particular product.

### Expert 2: Agreed. By having a separate class for ProductListing, we can easily manage and display all the relevant product information without cluttering other classes.

### Expert 3: This is a great start, but I do have a question for the user. Question: Are there any specific requirements for customer support? For example, should customers be able to submit support tickets, or do they have other means of contacting support? 
### Instructions: Solution:

1. Create a Customer class with the following attributes: name, email, address, and balance.
2. Add operations to the Customer class: browseProducts(), createAccount(), placeOrder(), and getOrders().
3. Create a BusinessOwner class with attributes for productID, productName, price, quantityAvailable, orderTracking, and customerSupport.
4. Incorporate operations into the BusinessOwner class: manageListings(), trackOrders(), and handleCustomerSupport().
5. Establish an Order class with the following attributes: orderID, datePlaced, productsOrdered, and totalCost.
6. Add methods to the Order class: cancelOrder() and calculateTotalCost().
7. Include additional attributes for the ProductListing class: productID, productName, description, and price.
8. Implement a method for the ProductListing class to retrieve the quantityAvailable.
9. Create associations between the classes as follows:
   a. Customer class should have a one-to-many association with the Order class.
   b. Order class will have a one-to-many association with the ProductListing class.
   c. BusinessOwner class should have a one-to-many association with the ProductListing class as well.
10. Your UML class diagram is complete. Continue with the implementation process to create the actual website.

Note: Although this solution caters to the basic needs of the system, additional refinements may be required based on the specific requirements and desired functionality of the handmade crafts website.

### PlantUML:
Filename: handmade_crafts_website.puml@startuml

class Customer {
  - name: String
  - email: String
  - address: String
  - balance: double
  + browseProducts()
  + createAccount()
  + placeOrder()
  + getOrders()
}

class BusinessOwner {
  - productID: int
  - productName: String
  - price: double
  - quantityAvailable: int
  - orderTracking: ArrayList<Order>
  - customerSupport: ArrayList<String>
  + manageListings()
  + trackOrders()
  + handleCustomerSupport()
}

class Order {
  - orderID: int
  - datePlaced: Date
  - productsOrdered: ArrayList<ProductListing>
  - totalCost: double
  + cancelOrder()
  + calculateTotalCost()
}

class ProductListing {
  - productID: int
  - productName: String
  - description: String
  - price: double
  + retrieveQuantityAvailable()
}

Customer "1" --> "0..*" Order
Order "1" --> "0..*" ProductListing
BusinessOwner "1" --> "0..*" ProductListing
