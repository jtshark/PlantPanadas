### Request: Our project is aimed at creating a mobile application that helps users track and monitor their water intake throughout the day, with reminders and graphical representations of progress to encourage them to meet their daily targets.
### Expert 1: So, we have a user request to design the class diagram for a mobile application that helps users track and monitor their water intake, right?

### Expert 2: Yes, that's correct. We should start by identifying the main entities involved in this application. I think we can have a User class to represent each user of the app.

### Expert 3: That sounds like a good starting point. The User class will likely have attributes such as name, age, and maybe even a target daily water intake. Additionally, we'll need a class for the actual water intake records.

### Expert 1: Agreed. Let's create a WaterIntake class to represent that. It'll require attributes like date, time, and the amount of water consumed.

### Expert 2: We should also consider the feature of setting reminders for users to drink water. Maybe we could have a Reminder class with attributes such as notification time and frequency?

### Expert 3: That's a great idea. We can associate the Reminder class with the User class using a one-to-many relationship.

### Expert 1: Hmm, what about the graphical representations of progress? Would that require any new classes?

### Expert 2: We could have a separate class called ProgressTracker that collects data from the WaterIntake class for each user and provides graphical representations.

### Expert 3: I like it. The ProgressTracker class could include methods like getWaterIntakeByDay to generate a graph showing daily water intake.

### Expert 1: Makes sense. We could also consider implementing a visual representation of remaining water intake for the day using a Gauge class.

### Expert 2: That's a good idea. We should include the Gauge class and associate it with the User and ProgressTracker classes.

### Expert 3: Agreed. This way, the user can easily see their progress towards meeting their daily target.

### Expert 1: One more thing to think about: how will the user be reminded? Should we integrate with the system notification API?

### Expert 2: Yes, I think that would be a good approach. We can have a separate class called NotificationHandler to handle system notifications.

### Expert 3: That's a practical approach. However, we'll need some additional details from the user. For example, how frequently should the reminders be sent?

### QUESTION: What frequency would you like for the reminders? Every hour, every two hours? 
### Answer:  Every two hours.
### Expert 1: Great, so we can set the reminder frequency to every two hours in the NotificationHandler class.

### Expert 2: I think we should also include a method in the User class to enable or disable reminders. This way users can personalize their experience.

### Expert 3: Absolutely. Let's add a boolean attribute, like isReminderEnabled, to the User class to control that.

### Expert 1: It seems like we have covered most of the main features requested by the user. Are there any other details we missed?

### Expert 2: One thing we should consider is the ability to display a summary of the user's water intake over a specific period of time, like a week or a month.

### Expert 3: That's a good point. We can add a method in the User class, like getWaterIntakeSummaryByPeriod, that takes a start and end date as parameters to retrieve the water intake records for that period.

### Expert 1: Excellent. Overall, our class diagram contains the User class, WaterIntake class, Reminder class, ProgressTracker class, Gauge class, NotificationHandler class, and the respective associations between them.

### Expert 2: I think this will provide a solid foundation for implementing the features requested by the user to help them track and monitor their water intake throughout the day.

### Expert 3: Agreed. With this diagram, we have captured the basic structure, attributes, and methods necessary to fulfill the user's needs.

### Expert 1: Now, we can hand over this class diagram to the development team for implementation and move forward with other aspects of the project.

### Expert 2: Yes, and as development progresses, any further questions or feedback from the user can be addressed and incorporated into the design. That way, the final product will truly meet their requirements.

### Expert 3: Absolutely. It's always important to remain flexible and open to improvements throughout the development process.
### Instructions: Here is a step-by-step solution for designing the class diagram for the mobile application that helps users track and monitor their water intake:

Step 1: Create a User class.
  - Add attributes: name, age, isReminderEnabled (boolean), and targetDailyWaterIntake (in ml).

Step 2: Create a WaterIntake class.
  - Add attributes: date, time, amount (in ml).
  
Step 3: Create a Reminder class.
  - Add attributes: notificationTime, frequency (in minutes).

Step 4: Create a ProgressTracker class.
  - Add methods: getWaterIntakeByDay(startDate, endDate) to generate a graph showing daily water intake.

Step 5: Create a Gauge class.
  - No additional attributes or methods needed.

Step 6: Create a NotificationHandler class.
  - No additional attributes or methods needed.
  
Step 7: Associate classes together:
  - User class has a one-to-many association with WaterIntake class (one user can have multiple water intake records).
  - User class has a one-to-many association with Reminder class (one user can have multiple reminders).
  - User class has a one-to-one association with ProgressTracker class (one user has one progress tracker).
  - User class has a one-to-one association with Gauge class (one user has one gauge).
  
Step 8: Set associations:
  - Use '1' at the aggregate/composition or association end where responsible for creating and managing the associated instances ('owner'), which is User class in our case.

That's it! This sequential solution outlines the steps required to design the class diagram for the given mobile application. Once implemented, the application will assist users in tracking and monitoring their water intake using reminders and graphical representations of progress.

### PlantUML:
Filename: water_intake_app.puml

```
@startuml

class User {
    - name: string
    - age: int
    - isReminderEnabled: boolean
    - targetDailyWaterIntake: int
    
    + setReminderStatus(isEnabled: boolean): void
}

class WaterIntake {
    - date: date
    - time: time
    - amount: int
}

class Reminder {
    - notificationTime: time
    - frequency: int
}

class ProgressTracker {
    + getWaterIntakeByDay(startDate: date, endDate: date): graph
}

class Gauge {}

class NotificationHandler {}

User --> "1" WaterIntake
User --> "1" Reminder
User --> "1" ProgressTracker
User --> "1" Gauge
