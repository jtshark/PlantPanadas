### Request: I am building a website that will sell unique handmade crafts, where customers can browse products, make purchases using a shopping cart system and leave feedback, while I can manage the products, orders and shipping information.
### Expert 1: So, it seems like we have a clear idea of what the user wants. We need to design a UML class diagram that depicts the structure of their website for selling unique handmade crafts. Let's break down the requirements and discuss them one by one.

### Expert 2: Agreed. First, we should focus on the browsing functionality. We can have a "Product" class to represent each unique handmade craft. It can have attributes like the name, description, price, and maybe a `getDiscountedPrice` method that calculates the discounted price based on any ongoing promotional offers.

### Expert 3: That sounds good. But what about the shopping cart system? Should we just make a separate class for it?

### Expert 1: Yes, we definitely need a "ShoppingCart" class. It can contain an array or list of "Product" objects. Additionally, we could have methods to add products, remove products, and calculate the total price of all items in the cart.

### Expert 2: Great. Now, let's move on to the feedback functionality. We can either include a feedback attribute for each "Product" object or create a separate class called "Feedback" which is associated with each "Product." What do you think?

### Expert 3: I think creating a separate class for feedback makes more sense. This way, we can have attributes like the rating, comment, and maybe even the date of submission. We can also include methods to get the average rating for a product and display all the comments.

### Expert 1: Good point. It would also be helpful to have a "User" class to represent the customers and the website owner. This class could include attributes like the username, password, and email address. We can restrict the user's access to certain features, such as managing products or orders, based on their role (customer or website owner).

### Expert 2: Absolutely. Now, for managing the products, the website owner needs some additional functionalities. We can have an "Admin" class, derived or associated with the "User" class, which contains methods like addProduct, editProduct, and removeProduct.

### Expert 3: And what about managing the orders and shipping? Should we create separate classes for them?

### Expert 1: It makes sense to create an "Order" class that represents each transaction. It can have attributes like order number, date, status, and total price. Additionally, we can include methods to calculate taxes or apply discounts and get the shipping information.

### Expert 2: That's true. Also, we could associate the "User" class with the "Order" class to determine which customer placed the order. And if the order involves multiple products, we can use a composition relationship between the "Order" and "Product" classes.

### Expert 3: In this case, it might be useful to have a separate "Address" class to store the shipping information. The "Order" class can then have an attribute with reference to the associated "Address" object.

### Expert 1: Exactly. And let's not forget about additional classes like "Payment" or "CreditCard" to handle the payment process. It can have attributes like card number, expiration date, and a method to process the payment.

### Expert 2: True. And finally, we could consider having a "Category" class to arrange the products into different categories, making it easier for customers to browse the website.

### Expert 3: I agree. Grouping products into categories would enhance the user experience.

### Expert 1: So, summarizing our discussions, we have identified the following classes: Product, ShoppingCart, Feedback, User, Admin, Order, Address, Payment, CreditCard, and Category. We have defined their basic attributes and some methods. We may need to seek further clarification from the user regarding how they want to handle certain scenarios, like adding products or processing payments.
### Instructions: Sure, here is a step-by-step solution for designing the class diagram:

1. Create a "Product" class with attributes such as name, description, price, and methods like `getDiscountedPrice`.

2. Create a "ShoppingCart" class that contains an array or list of "Product" objects, along with methods to add products, remove products, and calculate the total price.

3. Create a "Feedback" class with attributes such as rating, comment, and date of submission. Include methods to calculate the average rating and display comments.

4. Create a "User" class with attributes like username, password, and email. Define appropriate methods.

5. Create an "Admin" class derived from or associated with the "User" class, including methods to add, edit, and remove products.

6. Create an "Order" class with attributes like order number, date, status, and total price. Associate it with the "User" class to link each order with the customer.

7. Create an "Address" class with attributes for shipping information. Associate it with the "Order" class.

8. Create a "Payment" or "CreditCard" class with attributes like card number and expiration date. Include a method to process the payment.

9. Create a "Category" class to group products into different categories for easier browsing.

10. Define relationships between classes, such as the composition relationship between "Order" and "Product", and associations between "User" and other classes as needed.

By following these steps, you can design a class diagram that supports the functionalities of a website selling unique handmade crafts.

  - description: string
  - price: decimal
  + getDiscountedPrice(): decimal

class ShoppingCart {
  - products: Product[1..*]
