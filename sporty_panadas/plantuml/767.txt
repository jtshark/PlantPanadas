### Request: Design a social media application where users can create profiles, add friends, share posts, and like/comment on others' posts, while administrators can monitor user activity and manage site content.
### Expert 1: Alright, let's begin designing the class diagram for this social media application. We'll need to start with the main classes that represent the core functionality. I think we should have a User class to handle all the user-related operations. What do you guys think?

### Expert 2: I agree, the User class is essential. It should contain attributes such as username and password for authentication purposes. Additionally, we should include methods for creating a profile, adding friends, sharing posts, and liking or commenting on other posts.

### Expert 1: Absolutely, let's add those methods to the User class. For the profile creation, we might need to specify attributes like name, date of birth, bio, and maybe even profile picture. Should we include them directly in the User class?

### Expert 3: Instead of directly storing the date of birth, we could just have an attribute for the date of birth which can later be used to derive the age. This way, we avoid the need to update the age value every year.

### Expert 1: That makes sense. We can add a getDateOfBirth() method to User and calculate the age dynamically in another method such as getAge().

### Expert 2: Agreed. Now, let's move on to the Friend class. We'll need a way for users to add friends. Would it make sense to establish a "has-a" relationship from User to Friend?

### Expert 1: Technically, yes, but in this scenario, it might be better if we define a separate FriendsList class. The User class can then have a reference to this class to manage adding and removing friends. It allows for better encapsulation and modularity.

### Expert 3: I see your point. By having a separate FriendsList class, we can organize friend-related functionality in a much cleaner way. User could then have a method like addFriend() which can be forwarded to the FriendsList class to handle the addition.

### Expert 2: Great idea. And let's not forget about the Post class. It would have attributes like title, content, timestamp, and maybe even a reference to the user who created it. Additionally, we can include methods for liking and commenting on posts as well.

### Expert 1: Agreed. The Post class will connect directly with the User class, as posts are associated with users. A Post might also have a reference to a Comment class, as we'd want to associate individual comments with each post.

### Expert 3: That's right, and by having its own separate class, we can define attributes for a Comment such as the content, timestamp, and the user who made the comment. It would be a "has-a" relationship with Post.

### Expert 1: Lastly, we'll need an Administrator class to handle user monitoring and content management. The Administrator class would grant them access to additional functionality that regular users wouldn't have.

### Expert 2: Absolutely, the Administrator class should have methods for monitoring user activity and managing site content. This would provide the separation of concerns we need.

### Expert 3: Agreed. And with that, I think we have all the basic classes we need for this social media application. We can add more attributes and methods as we go through the different functionalities in more detail.

### Expert 1: Yes, we'll go through more specifics, such as handling notifications, as we refine the diagram. But this initial layout gives us a solid foundation to work with. What do you guys think?

### Expert 2: I'm happy with it. And by using this class diagram as a guide, we can ensure that all aspects of the user's request are covered.

### Expert 3: Agreed. I'm looking forward to seeing the progress while we refine and expand on this diagram.
### Instructions: To design the class diagram for the social media application, follow these steps:

1. Create a "User" class with attributes like username, password, name, and date of birth. Add methods for profile creation, adding friends, sharing posts, liking or commenting on others' posts.

2. Create a "FriendsList" class that represents the list of friends for each user. This class will handle adding and removing friends. The User class should have a FriendsList object as an attribute and use it to manage friend operations.

3. Create a "Post" class with attributes such as title, content, timestamp, and a reference to the user who created it. Add methods for liking and commenting on posts. The Post class should have a "Comment" object as an attribute to associate comments with posts.

4. Create a "Comment" class with attributes like content, timestamp, and a reference to the user who made the comment.

5. Define a "Administrator" class with methods for monitoring user activity and managing site content.

6. Establish associations between classes:
   - User has-a FriendsList.
   - User shares many Posts, and a Post is associated with a User.
   - Post has-a Comment.

7. Represent the associations using multiplicity and roles, if necessary. For example:
   - User has-many Friends (FriendsList).
   - User has-many Posts.
   - Post includes-many Comments.

Your class diagram should now incorporate all the essential classes and their relationships, representing the core functionalities of the social media application. You can further refine the diagram by adding more attributes and methods as needed.

### PlantUML:
Filename: social_media_application.puml@startuml
class User {
- username: String
- password: String
- name: String
- dateOfBirth: Date
+ createProfile(): void
+ addFriend(): void
+ sharePost(): void
+ likePost(): void
+ commentOnPost(): void
}

class FriendsList {
}

class Post {
- title: String
- content: String
- timestamp: Date
- user: User
+ likePost(): void
+ commentOnPost(): void
}

class Comment {
- content: String
- timestamp: Date
- user: User
}

class Administrator {
+ monitorUserActivity(): void
+ manageSiteContent(): void
}

User --> FriendsList
User "1" --o "many" Post
