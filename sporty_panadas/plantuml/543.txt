### Request: Our project is to design a mobile application that allows users to create and track their daily exercise routine, including setting goals, tracking progress, and offering workout recommendations.
### Expert 1: So, our user wants a mobile application for exercise tracking. I think we should start by identifying the main entities and their attributes.

### Expert 2: Agreed. The main entity seems to be "User." We could start with attributes like name, age, gender, and email.

### Expert 3: That's a good start. We should also include "Exercise" as an entity and have attributes like name, description, intensity level, and duration. Additionally, we'll need an entity for "Workout" to store the user's daily routine. It could have attributes like date, exercises performed, and sets completed.

### Expert 1: Definitely. For the "Workout" entity, it might be useful to include a reference to the user who performed it. This way, we can associate each workout with a specific user.

### Expert 2: Yes, that way we can easily track a user's workout history. Now, should we also include some goal-related entities? For example, "Goal" with attributes such as type (weight loss, strength gain), target (e.g., lose 10 pounds), and deadline.

### Expert 3: Absolutely. By having separate goal entities, the user can set multiple goals and have tailored exercises recommended to them based on those goals.

### Expert 1: That's a great point. But I'm wondering if we should directly store the "age" attribute for the user entity. After all, the user's current age keeps changing. What if instead we store the user's "date of birth" and have a method in the user class to calculate the age?

### Expert 2: That makes sense. By doing so, the age of the user will always be up-to-date without needing to update it separately. Smart move!

### Expert 3: Also, we could add a method in the user class to calculate BMI (Body Mass Index) by weighing and measuring the user's height. This way, we provide a valuable health indicator.

### Expert 1: Excellent idea. Fitness-oriented users would surely appreciate having such health-related functionality built right into the app. Another suggestion: instead of storing the price and a discounted price for any premium/paid features in the app, what if we just store the price attribute and provide a method to calculate the discounted price based on any applicable discounts?

### Expert 2: I think that's a more scalable solution. By having a separate class for discounts and referring to it, we can easily add or modify discounts without modifying the structure of other classes.

### Expert 3: Absolutely. And if we ever want to introduce multiple pricing tiers, it would be much easier to handle with this design.

### Expert 1: Great point. It'll help us maintain flexibility and improve code maintenance in the long run. It seems like we're making good progress. Any other thoughts or aspects we should consider for the class diagram?

### Expert 2: Actually, I think we should consider adding an "Activity" entity as well. This could represent different types of exercises (e.g., running, weightlifting, yoga) and have attributes like name and required equipment.

### Expert 3: That's a great addition. It'll enable us to recommend exercises based on the user's preferences and available equipment.

### Expert 1: I agree. Including the "Activity" entity will improve the personalization aspect of the app, allowing users to choose exercises that align with their interests and resources. I think we now have a solid foundation for the UML class diagram.

### Expert 2: Agreed. Let's finalize it and then potentially seek clarification or feedback from the user to make sure we're on the right track.

### Expert 3: Sounds like a plan. Let's document our decisions and present the UML class diagram for further discussions.
### Instructions: 1. Create a class "User" with attributes:
   - name: String
   - dateOfBirth: Date
   - gender: String
   - email: String

2. Create a class "Exercise" with attributes:
   - name: String
   - description: String
   - intensityLevel: String
   - duration: int

3. Create a class "Workout" with attributes:
   - date: Date
   - exercises: List<Exercise>
   - setsCompleted: int

4. Add a reference attribute "user" from "Workout" to "User".

5. Create a class "Goal" with attributes:
   - type: String
   - target: String
   - deadline: Date

6. Create a class "Discount" with attributes:
   - name: String
   - percentage: double

7. Add methods in the "User" class:
   - calculateAge(): int
   - calculateBMI(height: double, weight: double): double

8. Add a method in the "User" class to calculate the discounted price:
   - calculateDiscountedPrice(price: double, discounts: List<Discount>): double

9. Create a class "Activity" with attributes:
   - name: String
   - requiredEquipment: List<String>

10. Create associations:
   - Add a one-to-many association between "User" and "Workout" (user can have multiple workouts).
   - Add a one-to-many association between "User" and "Goal" (user can have multiple goals).
   - Add a many-to-one association between "Exercise" and "Workout" (many exercises can be part of a workout).
   - Add a many-to-one association between "Activity" and "Exercise" (many exercises can belong to an activity).

11. Define the visibility and multiplicity for the associations based on the requirements.

12. Review and validate the UML class diagram to ensure completeness and accuracy.

This step-by-step solution will guide the experts in designing the class diagram for the mobile application. It covers the creation of relevant classes with their attributes, creation of associations between classes, and the addition of necessary methods.

### PlantUML:
Filename: exercise_tracker.puml@startuml

class User {
  - name: String
  - dateOfBirth: Date
  - gender: String
  - email: String

  + calculateAge(): int
  + calculateBMI(height: double, weight: double): double
  + calculateDiscountedPrice(price: double, discounts: List<Discount>): double
}

class Exercise {
  - name: String
  - description: String
  - intensityLevel: String
  - duration: int
}

class Workout {
  - date: Date
  - exercises: List<Exercise>
  - setsCompleted: int

  ..> User
}

class Goal {
  - type: String
  - target: String
  - deadline: Date

  ..> User
}

class Discount {
  - name: String
  - percentage: double
}

class Activity {
  - name: String
  - requiredEquipment: List<String>

  ..> Exercise
}

User "1" *-- "n" Workout
User "1" *-- "n" Goal
Exercise "n" *-- "1" Workout
Activity "n" *-- "1" Exercise
