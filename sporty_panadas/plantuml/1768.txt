### Request: We are designing a mobile app that will help people keep track of their daily expenses, set monthly budgets, and receive notifications to avoid overspending.
### Expert 1: Hi everyone, so it looks like we're designing a mobile app for expense tracking. We'll need to create a UML class diagram to capture the necessary functionality. Any initial thoughts on the design?

### Expert 2: Yes, we could start by modeling a class for the user, as they will have various attributes and methods related to their expenses and budget tracking.

### Expert 3: Agreed. We should also consider representing the expenses themselves, as they will have specific properties like date, category, and amount. Should we add a class for budgets as well?

### Expert 1: Definitely. Users will need the ability to set monthly spending limits, so a class for budgets is crucial. Additionally, we could consider adding a class for notifications since they play a key role in preventing overspending.

### Expert 2: I think it's also essential to capture the relationship between the user and expenses. Would it make sense to have a one-to-many association between the User and Expense classes?

### Expert 3: Yes, that seems logical. A single user can have multiple expenses, but an expense belongs to only one user. Shall I go ahead and add that relationship to the class diagram?

### Expert 1: Yes, please do. And while we're on the topic of expenses, how should we handle time-related functionalities like recording the date of an expense and allowing users to query their expenses by date range?

### Expert 2: That's a good point. Instead of creating separate attributes for day, month, and year, and accompanying getter and setter methods, we could introduce a class called Date to encapsulate the logic of capturing the date. User and Expense classes will then have associations with the Date class.

### Expert 3: I agree. It also provides flexibility if we were to add additional features related to dates in the future. We could include methods in the Date class for easier manipulation too, like returning the day of the week for an expense's date.

### Expert 1: Very true. Additionally, let's not forget using a method like getAge() in the User class could be more practical than directly storing the user's age. That way, we avoid having to update the age each year.

### Expert 2: Absolutely. It simplifies the process and minimizes the storage requirements. We just need to ensure the getAge() method calculates the age accurately based on the user's year of birth from the user attribute.

### Expert 3: Agreed. What about the budgets? Should we store them as attributes within the User class or create a separate class for budgets?

### Expert 1: Considering that a user can have multiple budgets with different properties like amount and start/end dates, it seems more appropriate to have a separate class for budgets. That way, it becomes easier to manage multiple budgets for a single user if needed.

### Expert 2: I think we're on the right track. Is there anything else we should consider or clarify before finalizing the UML class diagram?

### Expert 3: I believe we've covered all the major components of the app. However, one thing we may need clarification on is the notification functionality. How does the user want to receive these notifications? Will they be sent instantly when a budget limit is exceeded, or should we provide more options for customization?

### Expert 1: Excellent point. Let's make sure to clarify with the user about their preferred notification method and any additional customization requirements. That's crucial to ensure appropriate modeling and implementation for the Notification class.

### Expert 2: Agreed. Let's get that clarification. Once we have that information, we can finalize the UML class diagram and proceed with the implementation.
### Instructions: Step-by-Step Solution:

1. Start by creating a class diagram. Add classes for User, Expense, Budget, and Date.

2a. Add attributes to the User class: name, email, and birthDate. Use appropriate data types for each attribute.

2b. Add methods to the User class: getAge() to calculate age based on the birthDate attribute.

3a. Add attributes to the Expense class: date (of type Date), category, and amount.

3b. Create an association between the User and Expense classes. The User class should have a one-to-many association with Expense, indicating that a user can have multiple expenses, but an expense belongs to only one user.

4a. Add attributes to the Budget class: amount, startDate, and endDate.

4b. Create an association between the User and Budget classes. The User class should have a one-to-many association with Budget, indicating that a user can have multiple budgets, but a budget belongs to only one user.

5. Create a class called Notification to model the notification functionality.

6a. Add attributes to the Notification class, as per the clarification from the user. This may include properties such as notificationType (e.g., email/sms), content, and timestamp.

6b. Create an association between the Expense and Notification classes. The Expense class should have a one-to-many association with Notification, indicating that an expense can have multiple notifications.

6c. Create an association between the Budget and Notification classes. The Budget class should also have a one-to-many association with Notification, indicating that a budget can have multiple notifications.

7. Review the class diagram for completeness and accuracy, making any necessary adjustments based on the requirements provided and expert consensus.

8. Finalize the UML class diagram, ensuring that all attributes, methods, and associations are clear and correctly represented.

9. Document the UML class diagram, including a brief explanation of each class and its associations, as well as any additional specifications as required.

10. Share the UML class diagram with the development team for implementation.

Expense --> Notification: "1" --- "Multiple"
