### Request: I need a blueprint of how my project should function. For example, I want to create a social media platform where users can share pictures and videos amongst friends while being able to search for new videos and images from strangers.
### Expert 1: So, in order to create a blueprint for this social media platform, we should start by designing a UML class diagram. This will help us visualize the structure and behavior of the system. Let's discuss the main entities and relationships that we would need to represent.

### Expert 2: Agreed. The first obvious entity that comes to my mind is the "User" class. Each user in the system will have their own profile, and they will be able to upload and share pictures and videos.

### Expert 3: That's correct. We can define attributes for the "User" class such as username, password, email, and date of birth. Additionally, we may want to include methods like uploadMedia() and shareMedia() to handle the functionalities you mentioned earlier.

### Expert 1: Good point. Now, in order to enable sharing among friends, would we need another class? Maybe something like "Friendship"?

### Expert 2: Absolutely. The "Friendship" class would represent the connection between users who are friends. This could be a binary relationship where each instance represents the friendship between two users. We could include attributes like friendRequestStatus and dateOfFriendship.

### Expert 3: And to handle the searching aspect, we should consider adding a "Media" class. This class can have attributes like title, description, type, and fileData, along with methods for searching, favoriting, and commenting.

### Expert 1: I agree. It would make sense to handle pictures and videos in a generic way through a "Media" class, as they share common attributes and behaviors. By doing this, we keep the class diagram more maintainable and extensible.

### Expert 2: Additionally, we may want a "Feed" class where users can see the latest media posted by their friends and from strangers they follow. We can create relationships between "User" and "Feed" to represent that each user has a feed.

### Expert 3: That's a great idea. And to enable users to discover new content from strangers, we could incorporate a "Following" class that represents the relationship between users and the strangers they follow. This would add a many-to-many relationship between "User" and "User".

### Expert 1: Agreed. With the "Following" class, users can retrieve posts from the people they follow. Alternatively, users could retrieve all the media based on their preferences or by popular/trending media. We should discuss if we need a separate class for that.

### Expert 2: I think it would be reasonable to introduce a "Preferences" class to allow users to define their preferences for media. This class can have attributes like preferredTags and preferredCategories. Then, we can create a relationship between "User" and "Preferences".

### Expert 3: That would work well. Now, one last thing that comes to mind is handling comments and likes for media. Should we introduce a separate class for that, or incorporate those attributes within the "Media" class itself?

### Expert 1: I would suggest incorporating them within the "Media" class. Since comments and likes directly relate to the media, it would be more logical to have them as attributes of the "Media" class. We can use collections like commentList and likesCount to keep track of comments and likes.

### Expert 2: That makes sense. It will be easier to retrieve and handle comments and likes if they are encapsulated within the "Media" class.

### Expert 3: Exactly. By considering all these entities and their relationships, I believe we can create a comprehensive UML class diagram that visualizes the structure of the social media platform and efficiently represents the desired user functionalities.

### Expert 1: Agreed. I think we have a good starting point for the UML class diagram. We should start sketching it out and see if we encounter any other questions or uncertainties.

### Expert 2: That's a plan. Once we have a draft diagram, we can review it for any missing details or possible improvements. That way, we ensure a solid blueprint for your project.
### Instructions: Step-by-step solution for creating the UML class diagram:

1. Create the "User" class:
   - Add attributes such as username, password, email, and dateOfBirth.

2. Add methods to the "User" class:
   - Implement methods like uploadMedia() and shareMedia().

3. Create the "Friendship" class:
   - Include attributes friendRequestStatus and dateOfFriendship.

4. Establish a relationship between "User" and "Friendship":
   - Represent that each "User" can have multiple "Friendships".

5. Create the "Media" class:
   - Add attributes like title, description, type, and fileData.

6. Include methods in the "Media" class:
   - Implement methods for searching, favoriting, and commenting on media.

7. Design the "Feed" class:
   - Establish a relationship between "User" and "Feed" to represent that each "User" can have a feed.

8. Discuss and decide on how to handle following strangers:
   - Draft a secondary class, "Following", to establish a many-to-many relationship between "User" and "User" for interactions with strangers.

9. Create the "Preferences" class:
   - Define attributes like preferredTags and preferredCategories.

10. Establish a relationship between "User" and "Preferences":
   - Represent that each "User" can have preferences by linking these two classes.

11. Add comments and likes functionality:
   - Incorporate these attributes within the "Media" class to simplify association and retrieval.

12. Use collections for comments and likes:
   - Implement commentList and likesCount as attributes within the "Media" class.

Once you have completed these steps, you will have a comprehensive UML class diagram that accurately represents the structure and behavior of your desired social media platform.

### PlantUML:
Filename: social_media_platform.puml

```
@startuml
class User {
  - username
  - password
  - email
  - dateOfBirth
  + uploadMedia()
  + shareMedia()
}

class Friendship {
  - friendRequestStatus
  - dateOfFriendship
}

class Media {
  - title
  - description
  - type
  - fileData
  + search()
  + favorite()
  + comment()
}

class Feed
class Following

class Preferences {
  - preferredTags
  - preferredCategories
}

User --> Friendship
User --> Preferences
User --> Feed
User *-- User: Follows
Feed --> Media
Following --> User: Follows
Following --> User: Follower
LikedMedia *-- Media
CommentedMedia *-- Media

class LikedMedia {
  - mediaList
}

class CommentedMedia {
  - mediaList
}

The UML class diagram for the social media platform with users, friendships, media, feeds, following, preferences, liked media, and commented media classes is successfully created in the social_media_platform.puml file.
