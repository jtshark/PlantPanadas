### Request: Our project is a travel booking system, where users can search for and select flights, hotels, and activities, and then book and pay for their entire trip all in one place.
### Expert 1: So, our user needs a travel booking system that allows them to search, select, and book flights, hotels, and activities. I think we should start by identifying the main entities involved in this system.

### Expert 2: I agree. We can have entities like User, Flight, Hotel, and Activity. Those seem like the primary classes to start with. 

### Expert 3: Right, and we'll need some associations between these classes. For example, a User can book multiple Flights, Hotels, and Activities, and a Flight, Hotel or Activity can be booked by multiple Users.

### Expert 1: That makes sense. We can represent the booking functionality with a many-to-many association between User and each of the three classes: Flight, Hotel, and Activity.

### Expert 2: Additionally, we should consider attributes for each class. For example, the Flight class could have attributes like origin, destination, departure date, and price. The same goes for Hotel and Activity classes.

### Expert 3: Absolutely. And we can also think about adding methods to enhance the functionality of these classes. For instance, for the User class, we could include a method like makeBooking(). This could encapsulate the process of selecting and booking either a flight, a hotel, or an activity for a user.

### Expert 1: Good point. Another thing to consider is the payment functionality. We might need to think about adding a Payment class that can be associated with various bookings. That way, we can track the payment status and details for each booking.

### Expert 2: That's true. We can have the Payment class associated with the Booking class and include attributes such as paymentStatus, paymentAmount, and paymentMethod.

### Expert 3: Additionally, the Activity class could have a method like calculatePrice() to include any additional fees or discounts based on the user's selection.

### Expert 1: Agreed. So far, we covered the main entities and associations. Let's summarize what we have:

- 
### Instructions: Solution:

1. Create the User class with attributes like userId, username, password, email, and phoneNumber.
2. Create the Flight class with attributes like flightId, origin, destination, departureDate, price, and availability.
3. Add a many-to-many association between User and Flight classes for booking flights.
4. Create the Hotel class with attributes like hotelId, name, location, checkInDate, checkOutDate, pricePerNight, and availability.
5. Add a many-to-many association between User and Hotel classes for booking hotels.
6. Create the Activity class with attributes like activityId, name, location, startDate, endDate, price, and availability.
7. Add a many-to-many association between User and Activity classes for booking activities.
8. Create the Payment class with attributes like paymentId, bookingId, paymentStatus, paymentAmount, and paymentMethod.
9. Add an association between Payment and Booking classes to track payment details for each booking.
10. Add methods to the User class: makeBooking(flightId), makeBooking(hotelId), makeBooking(activityId) to facilitate bookings for users.
11. Add a calculatePrice() method in the Activity class to calculate the total price of the activity including any additional fees or discounts based on the user's selection.

Overall, this design includes the necessary classes, associations, and attributes to implement a travel booking system where users can search, select, book, and pay for their trips all in one place.
