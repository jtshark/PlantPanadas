### Request: We are creating an UML model of a mobile app that keeps track of the expenses for a group of friends on vacations, splitting them equally and letting users know how much they owe each other.
### Expert 1: So, our goal is to create a UML class diagram for a mobile app that manages expenses for a group of friends on vacations, right?

### Expert 2: Yes, that's correct.

### Expert 3: Alright! Before we begin, letâ€™s try to pinpoint the main functionalities of the app. Users should be able to enter their expenses, have them split equally among the group, and get notifications on how much each user owes or is owed, right?

### Expert 1: Absolutely. And we should consider that these expenses can vary in terms of their nature. For example, some expenses could be shared (like renting a car), while others could be individual (like buying souvenirs).

### Expert 2: That's a good point. We'll likely need to capture information about each expense, such as the description, the amount, and the date. Additionally, we'll need to keep track of the users involved, as well as their individual balances.

### Expert 3: Right. Let's start by focusing on the main classes we will need. I assume there will be a User class to represent each member of the group?

### Expert 1: Yes, that's correct. Each User will have attributes like name, email, and maybe even a profile picture.

### Expert 2: Agreed. Next, we should consider an Expense class to represent each individual expenditure. This class would contain attributes like description, amount, and date.

### Expert 3: Definitely. And since an Expense can involve multiple users, we'll need some way to relate the users to each particular expense. One approach could be to add a collection of user references in the Expense class. How does that sound?

### Expert 1: That could work, but what if we also want to keep track of the percentage each user contributed to the expense? That way, we can properly divide the expense among them.

### Expert 2: Yes, that's a good point. That raises the need for a Contribution class, which would have an amount attribute and could contain the reference to both the User and Expense classes. It will allow us to store each user's contribution to an expense.

### Expert 3: Great! Now we just need to capture the relationships among these classes. I think there would be a "Has" association between the User and Expense classes, indicating that a User can have several Expenses.

### Expert 1: Agreed. And we should probably also consider a "Contributed" association between the User and Contribution classes to show that a User can be associated with different Contributions.

### Expert 2: That makes sense. Lastly, we need to think about the User-to-User association. Since a user can owe or be owed by another user, we can establish a relationship labeled "Owes" or "Is Owed" between two User objects.

### Expert 3: Alright, our class diagram is shaping up nicely. Is there anything else we might be missing?

### Expert 1: I'm wondering if we should include any additional methods or attributes to make the app more convenient for the users. For example, storing the remaining balance each user has to pay or receive or calculating how much the group has spent so far.

### Expert 2: I think that's a great idea. We can add attributes like "balance" to the User class, as well as methods to calculate the unpaid balance and retrieve expenses by different criteria.

### Expert 3: Yes, these additional features will definitely enhance the usability of the app. We should make sure to clarify with the user if they require any specific statistics or if there's a need for integration with other systems or platforms.

### Expert 1: Agreed. We shouldn't forget that it's always essential to involve the user and clarify any uncertainties through questioning when making design decisions.

### Expert 2: Absolutely. It's important to ensure that our class diagram captures all the necessary functionalities and provides a solid foundation for the app's development.

### Expert 3: Well said. Let's proceed with our conclusions and refine the class diagram as we gather more information from the user.
### Instructions: Step-by-Step Solution for Designing the UML Class Diagram:

1. Identify the main classes:
   a. User - represents each member of the group.
   b. Expense - represents individual expenditures.
   c. Contribution - captures the contributions made by users to each expense.

2. Define attributes for each class:
   a. User:
      - name: string
      - email: string
      - profile picture: image (optional)

   b. Expense:
      - description: string
      - amount: double
      - date: Date

   c. Contribution:
      - amount: double

3. Create associations between the classes:
   a. User "Has" Expense:
      - A User can have multiple Expenses.
      - Multiplicity: 0..* for User and 1..* for Expense.

   b. User "Contributed" Contribution:
      - A User can be associated with multiple Contributions.
      - Multiplicity: 0..* for User and Contribution.

   c. User "Owes/Is Owed" User:
      - A User can owe or be owed by other Users.
      - Multiplicity: 0..1 for User and 0..* for User.

4. Add additional attributes or methods (optional) to enhance usability:
   a. User:
      - balance: double (remaining balance to pay or receive)
      - calculateUnpaidBalance(): double (calculates user's unpaid balance)

5. Review the class diagram with potential end-users for feedback and clarification.

6. Revise and refine the class diagram based on user feedback and requirements.

7. Validate the revised class diagram with domain experts and stakeholders.

8. Finalize the class diagram and document it appropriately for reference during the development phase.

### PlantUML:
Filename: expense_tracker_model.puml@startuml
class User {
  - name: string
  - email: string
  - profile picture: image (optional)
  <<balance>>
  {method} + calculateUnpaidBalance(): double
}

class Expense {
  - description: string
  - amount: double
  - date: Date
}

class Contribution {
  - amount: double
}

User "Has" -- "1..*" Expense
User "Contributed" -- "0..*" Contribution
User "Owes/Is Owed" -- "0..*" User
