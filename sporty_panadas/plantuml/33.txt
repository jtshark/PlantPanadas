### Request: Our project is a software that will allow users to keep track of their daily expenditures and budget.
### Expert 1: So we need to design a UML class diagram for the daily expenditure and budget tracking software. I think the main classes we'll need are "User", "Expense", and "Budget". What do you both think?

### Expert 2: That sounds good to me. We can probably also include some auxiliary classes like "Category" to categorize expenses and "Transaction" to keep a record of individual transactions.

### Expert 3: Agreed. It would also be helpful to include a "Report" class to generate reports based on user input. This way, users can have a clear overview of their expenses and budget.

### Expert 1: Definitely. Now, let's talk about the attributes and methods of each class. For the "User" class, we might want to include attributes such as name, email, and password. We'll also need a method to authenticate the user during login. Since this is a budget tracking software, it may be useful to have additional attributes like a monthly income or even an account balance that the user can update.

### Expert 2: Good point. We can save the user's income as an attribute and allow them to update it periodically. We can also have a method to calculate the remaining disposable income by deducting expenses from the income.

### Expert 3: That's a great idea. Additionally, for the "Expense" class, we can include attributes such as amount, date, and description. We should also include a method to categorize each expense by associating it with a particular "Category" object. This will allow users to easily track how much they spend in each category.

### Expert 1: Agreed. We can also consider adding a method to calculate the total expenditure for a given time period or category to provide users with more insights.

### Expert 2: For the "Budget" class, we can have attributes like monthly_limit and start_date. We can also add a method to calculate whether the user is over or under their allocated budget, and if so, by how much.

### Expert 3: Absolutely. And by associating the "Expense" class with the corresponding "Budget" object, we can keep a running total of the user's expenditures and compare it against their budget limit.

### Expert 1: This is coming together nicely. Moving on to the "Report" class, we can include attributes such as the start and end date for the report period. We'll also need a method to generate and display the report, including information like the total expenses, categorical breakdowns, and budget utilization.

### Expert 2: Yes, excellent. This way users can review their spendings and make more informed decisions to better manage their finances.

### Expert 3: Agreed. Is there anything else we need to consider for our class diagram? We should always aim to capture user requirements accurately to avoid unnecessary rework.

### Expert 1: I can't think of anything else right now. But let's run through what we have one more time. We have the "User" class with attributes such as name, email, password, income, and methods for authentication and calculating disposable income. The "Expense" class with attributes like amount, date, and description, as well as methods for categorization and calculation. The "Budget" class with attributes for monthly limit and start date, and the "Report" class for generating reports based on given parameters.

### Expert 2: That sums it up nicely. Our class diagram appears to cover the main functionalities of the expenditure and budget tracking software. If any ambiguities or uncertainties arise, we can always seek clarification from the user.

### Expert 3: Exactly. We should prioritize communicating with the user to validate our design choices and make sure it meets their needs. Once we have their feedback, we can proceed with confidently implementing the system.
### Instructions: Solution:

Step 1: Create the "User" class
- Add attributes: name (string), email (string), password (string), monthly income (double).
- Implement methods: authenticateUser(), calculateDisposableIncome().

Step 2: Create the "Expense" class
- Add attributes: amount (double), date (date), description (string).
- Implement methods: categorizeExpense(Category category), calculateTotalExpenditure(), calculateExpenditureByCategory().

Step 3: Create the "Budget" class
- Add attributes: monthly_limit (double), start_date (date).
- Implement methods: calculateBudgetUtilization(), calculateRemainingBudget().

Step 4: Create the "Category" class
- Add attributes: name (string).
- Define associations: One-to-many association between "Category" and "Expense" classes.

Step 5: Create the "Transaction" class (auxiliary)
- Add attributes: amount (double), date (date).
- Define associations: One-to-many association between "Transaction" and "Expense" classes.

Step 6: Create the "Report" class
- Add attributes: start_date (date), end_date (date).
- Implement methods: generateReport(), displayReport().

Step 7: Establish associations between classes
- User-Expense association: One-to-many association between "User" and "Expense" classes.
- User-Budget association: One-to-one association between "User" and "Budget" classes.
- Expense-Budget association: One-to-one association between "Expense" and "Budget" classes.
- Category-Expense association: One-to-many association between "Category" and "Expense" classes.

With these steps, the class diagram for the daily expenditure and budget tracking software should accurately represent the main functionalities and relationships of the system. It combines essential classes like "User", "Expense", "Budget", "Category", "Transaction", and "Report", creating associations that capture the necessary data flow and interactions between these classes.
