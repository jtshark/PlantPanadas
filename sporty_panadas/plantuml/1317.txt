### Request: Develop a social media website where users can create accounts, connect with friends, post status updates, photos, videos, and like and comment on other user's posts.
### Expert 1: So, the user has requested us to design a class diagram for a social media website. The first thing that comes to mind is to have a User class, as users can create accounts. What other classes do you think we should include?

### Expert 2: Definitely, we should have a Post class to represent status updates, photos, and videos. Users can create and share these posts. We'll also need a class for comments and likes, since users can like and comment on other users' posts.

### Expert 3: That's a good start. To connect with friends, should we include a FriendRequest class?

### Expert 1: I think it would be more appropriate to have a Friendship class instead. This way, we can represent both the pending friend requests and the actual friendships between users.

### Expert 2: Right, that makes sense. How about representing the connection between the User class and the Friendship class? Should we have a separate class for this relationship?

### Expert 3: Rather than having a separate class, I think we can simply use a relationship line annotating that a User can have one or more Friendships. This way, it simplifies the diagram and shows the association more clearly.

### Expert 1: Agreed. Now, let's talk about the attributes and methods for each class. For the User class, we can include attributes like username, password, and email. Any suggestions for additional attributes?

### Expert 2: We should also consider adding a profile picture and a list of friends to the User class. These attributes are relevant to the functionality of the social media website.

### Expert 3: Absolutely. It's also a good idea to include a method that allows users to add friends by sending friend requests. We can name it "addFriend" and specify it as a behavior in the class diagram.

### Expert 1: Definitely. Now, let's move on to the Post class. In addition to content and timestamp attributes, we should include attributes like number of likes and comments. What methods do you think would be appropriate for this class?

### Expert 2: We should add methods to allow users to like and comment on posts. Let's call them "likePost" and "commentPost," respectively.

### Expert 3: Agreed. And should we include an attribute for the user who created the post?

### Expert 1: That's a good point. We need to capture that information as well, so let's include an attribute for the user.

### Expert 2: Moving on to the Friendship class, I think having an attribute denoting the status (such as pending or accepted) of the friendship would be useful. This would allow us to keep track of friend requests.

### Expert 1: Great idea. Now, let's think about how we can represent the polymorphic nature of comments and likes. Should we create separate classes for each type or have a base class?

### Expert 3: I suggest we create a base class called Interaction, which can have child classes like Comment and Like. With this approach, we can have a single relationship line from the Post class to the Interaction class.

### Expert 2: That makes sense, as comments and likes share some common behaviors, like being associated with a post. And it allows us to easily extend the functionality in the future if needed.

### Expert 1: Yes, and it presents a more compact and meaningful diagram. I think we've covered most of the major functionality. Is there anything else that you think we should consider?

### Expert 3: Well, we haven't addressed the privacy settings and user preferences. Should we add classes for those? Maybe, PrivacySetting and Preferences?

### Expert 2: I believe handling privacy and preferences can be treated with attributes in the User class itself. We can specify certain attributes for privacy settings and user preferences to control the visibility of posts and other user-related information.

### Expert 1: That's a good point. We can mention those control attributes in the class diagram along with the required descriptions.

### Expert 3: Agreed. And if we have any more questions or need clarification from the user, we should make sure we mark it as a question.

### Expert 2: Absolutely, let's keep that in mind. I think we've covered all the major aspects for designing the UML class diagram for the social media website. Shall we move forward with creating the diagram based on our discussions?

### Expert 1: Yes, let's finalize the class diagram incorporating all the discussed aspects and present it to the user for their further feedback.


### Instructions: Solution:

Step 1: Create the User Class
- Create a class named "User" to represent users on the social media website.
- Add the following attributes to the User class:
  username: string
  password: string
  email: string
  profilePicture: Image
  friends: List<User>
- Include the following methods in the User class:
  addFriend(friend: User)

Step 2: Create the Post Class
- Create a class named "Post" to represent user posts on the social media website.
- Add the following attributes to the Post class:
  content: string
  timestamp: DateTime
  likes: List<Like>
  comments: List<Comment>
  author: User
   > (*), where the arrow specifies the end where User class is in multiple

Step 3: Create the Friendship Class
- Create a class named "Friendship" to represent friendships on social media.
- Add the following attributes to the Friendship class:
  status: FriendshipStatus
- Include a composition relationship reflecting friendship between users:
  user: User ------- Friendship -----> User

Step 4: Create the Interaction Base Class
- Create an abstract class named "Interaction" as the base class for likes and comments.
  
Step 5: Create the Like and Comment Classes
- Create classes named "Like" and "Comment" extending the Interaction base class.
- > Inside Post -- Interaction     Owes (*)  

Step 6: Handle User Attributes
- Add privacySetting: Privacy enum attribute to the User class representing privacy preferences.
- Include methods for modifying privacy and personal information inside the User class if required.

Step 7: Finalize the Class Diagram
- Review the diagram and ensure it covers all the required functionality and relationships as discussed.

The sequential solution provided above highlights the steps required to design the class diagram for the social media website, incorporating the discussed class structures, attributes, relationships, and methods.
