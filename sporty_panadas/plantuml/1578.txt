### Request: Our project involves creating a social media website where users can post, like, and comment on pictures and videos, as well as follow other users and gain followers themselves.
### Expert 1: So, our user wants us to design a UML class diagram for a social media website. We need to consider features like posting, liking, and commenting on pictures and videos, as well as following other users and gaining followers ourselves.

### Expert 2: Right. Let's start by identifying the main entities involved. We obviously have the User entity. Additionally, we'll need entities for Post, Picture, Video, and Comment. Any other entities we should consider?

### Expert 3: We should also include entities for Likes, Follows, and Followers. These will represent the relationships between users, allowing them to like a post, follow another user, and gain followers themselves.

### Expert 1: That makes sense. Now, let's determine the attributes for each entity. For User, we could have attributes like name, email, username, password, date of birth, and bio.

### Expert 2: Good point. For Post, we can include attributes like caption, date and time of creation, number of likes, and number of comments. Picture and Video entities could have their own specific attributes such as resolution, file format, and duration.

### Expert 3: We should also consider attributes like visibility and privacy settings for User and Post entities. Users might want to control who can see their information and posts.

### Expert 1: Agreed. Adding those attributes will give us more flexibility in designing the system. Now, moving on to relationships. A Post is created by a User, so there would be an association between User and Post entities.

### Expert 2: Right. Additionally, a Post can have multiple Comments. So, we would have a composition association between Post and Comment.

### Expert 3: We should also include associations for a user liking a Post and following other users. So there would be an association between User and Like, as well as User and Follows entities.

### Expert 1: Yes, exactly. It's important to record all these relationships so the system can keep track of user actions and interactions within the social media website.

### Expert 2: One thing to consider is how to represent the number of followers a User has. We can either store this as an attribute in the User entity, or we can calculate it dynamically by counting the number of Follows associated with a user.

### Expert 3: Good point. I would prefer calculating the number of followers dynamically because it ensures data consistency. If we save it as an attribute, we need to update it every time there is a change, which could lead to data inconsistency.

### Expert 1: Another related issue to think about is how to handle showing a User's content based on their privacy settings. Should we include methods in the diagram to handle visibility?

### Expert 2: I think it would be more practical to include privacy as an attribute in the User entity and then have related methods such as "isContentVisibleTo(User viewer)" in the Post, Picture, and Video entities. This way, we can easily check if the content should be visible to a particular viewer or not.

### Expert 3: Agreed. Including the visibility-related attributes and methods will help implement and enforce the privacy settings in the system.

### Expert 1: Looks like we have our main entities, attributes, and relationships outlined for our UML class diagram. However, we might need some further clarification from the user. Like, how would they like to handle post feeds? Will they be dependent on the followers' activities or display all posts from followed users regardless? 

### Expert 2: That's a valid point. We should clarify with the user how they want the post feeds to be organized and if there are any specific algorithms or rules for it.

### Expert 3: Yeah, understanding that will significantly influence how we design our system, especially the methods responsible for fetching and displaying posts in a user's feed.

### Expert 1: Agreed. Let's finalize our class diagram and then reach out to the user with our questions to ensure we meet their requirements.

### Expert 2: Sounds like a plan. We should preface our questions with "### QUESTION" to make it clear to the user and avoid any confusion.

### Expert 3: Great, let's work on finalizing the class diagram and gather all the relevant questions to ask the user.

### Instructions: 1. Start by identifying the main entities involved in the social media website:
   - User
   - Post
   - Picture
   - Video
   - Comment
   - Likes
   - Follows
   - Followers

2. Create a User class with the following attributes:
   - name: string
   - email: string
   - username: string
   - password: string
   - dateOfBirth: date
   - bio: string
   - visibility: boolean (for privacy settings)

3. Create a Post class with the following attributes:
   - caption: string
   - createdAt: datetime
   - numLikes: integer
   - numComments: integer
   - visibility: boolean

4. Create separate Picture and Video classes with attributes specific to each type (e.g., resolution, file format, duration).

5. Create a Comment class with the following attributes:
   - text: string
   - createdAt: datetime

6. Create separate Like classes with no additional attributes.

7. Create a Follow class with no additional attributes.

8. Determine the association relationships between the classes:
   - User has a composition association with Post, where a User can create multiple Posts.
   - Post has a composition association with Comment, where a Post can have multiple Comments.
   - User has a composition association with Likes, where User can like multiple Posts.
   - User has a composition association with Follows, where a User can follow multiple Users.
   - User has another composition association with Followers, where a User can have multiple Followers.

9. Consider implementing privacy settings and visibility:
   - Add visibility attribute to User to control the privacy settings.
   - Add methods in Post, Picture, and Video to check if the content should be visible to a particular viewer based on their privacy settings.

10. Optional: Define methods in each class to handle activities such as posting, liking, and following other users.

Once you follow these steps, you can finalize the class diagram and reach out to the user with any further questions or considerations before implementing the solution.

Note: It's important to keep in mind that this UML class diagram is a simplified representation and additional aspects, such as methods and more specific attributes, need to be considered during the actual implementation phase.
