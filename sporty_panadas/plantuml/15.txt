### Request: My project is a social media platform where users can create profiles, connect with friends, post updates, photos and videos, and like, comment, and share content.
### Expert 1: So, for this social media platform, we definitely need a way to represent users and their profiles. How about starting with the User class?

### Expert 2: That sounds like a good starting point. We can define attributes like "name," "username," and "email" to store the basic user information.

### Expert 3: Right, and we can also include a "password" attribute for user authentication and a "dateOfBirth" attribute to calculate the user's age.

### Expert 1: Good point, but do you think we should actually store the date of birth? In some cases, we might only want to display the user's age without using the date for any other purpose.

### Expert 2: Yes, you're right. It might be better to store just the age as a calculated attribute or method, rather than the full date of birth.

### Expert 3: I agree. By calculating the age based on the date of birth, we ensure that the age information is always accurate and up to date, without having to rely on the user to update it manually.

### Expert 1: Absolutely. And since the age will change over time, we can implement a method called "getAge()" to return the user's current age whenever it's needed. That way, we don't have to update the age value separately every year.

### Expert 2: That's a clean solution. Another essential feature is the capability to connect with friends. We can introduce an association between  User class called "friends" which would represent a user's connections.

### Expert 3: Right, we can represent the "friends" association as a list or an array, with each element indicating another User object that the current user is connected to. This would allow users to maintain a list of their friends, enabling activities like sharing posts and getting notifications.

### Expert 1: Definitely, and speaking of posts, we should also introduce a Post class where users can create and share their updates, photos, and videos.

### Expert 2: Great idea! And the Post class can have attributes like "content," "createdAt" to store the creation date, and maybe an "owner" attribute referring to the User who authored the post.

### Expert 3: Sounds good. To enhance the social media experience, let's add some interactions options like "likes" and "comments". We can have separate classes for Like and Comment and define associations between them and the Post class.

### Expert 1: Great suggestion! By having separate classes for Likes and Comments, we allow more flexibility in tracking and managing those interactions. We can potentially implement features like viewing a user's liked posts or deleting comments, which might require additional behavior.

### Expert 2: Absolutely. This modularity allows us to extend the functionality in the future and keep the model clean and maintainable.

### Expert 3: Agreed. It's crucial to design the UML class diagram in such a way that it empowers the development team to implement new features easily while providing a scalable infrastructure for future enhancements.

### Expert 1: So far, we've covered users, profiles, posts, friends, likes, and comments. Is there anything else we need to consider based on the user's initial request?

### Expert 2: We have a good foundation here, but we might want to revisit and refine our diagram as we go, keeping in mind any additional user requirements that come up during development or future enhancements.

### Expert 3: That's right. It's important to have regular discussions with the development team and users to ensure our class diagram accurately represents the real-world requirements and functional needs of the social media platform.

### Expert 1: Agreed. With ongoing collaboration and iteration, we will be able to shape the UML class diagram into a powerful representation of the social media platform, supporting its features and potential future growth.
### Instructions: Step-by-step solution for designing the UML class diagram:

1. Create a User class:
    - Add attributes: name, username, email, password
    - Add a calculated method: getAge() to calculate and return the user's age

2. Create a Post class:
    - Add attributes: content, createdAt
    - Add an attribute: owner referencing the User class

3. Create a List class to store the user's friends:
    - Add a friends attribute: a list or array of User objects

4. Create a Like class:
    - No attributes needed

5. Create a Comment class:
    - No attributes needed

6. Define associations between the classes:
    - User class:
      - Add an association: friends with a multiplicity of "many" indicating User objects
      - Add an association: posts with a multiplicity of "many" indicating Post objects
      - Add an association: likedPosts with a multiplicity of "many" indicating Post objects (to be liked)

    - Post class:
      - Add an association: likedBy with a multiplicity of "many" indicating User objects (who liked the post)
      - Add an association: comments with a multiplicity of "many" indicating Comment objects

    - Like class:
      - Add an association: post with a multiplicity of "one" indicating Post object (which is liked)

    - Comment class:
      - Add an association: post with a multiplicity of "one" indicating Post object (which is commented on)
      - Add an association: commentator with a multiplicity of "one" indicating User object (who commented)

7. Finalize the class diagram:
    - Ensure class names and attributes are properly labeled and presented
    - Add navigability arrows to represent the appropriate direction of relationships
    - Include multiplicities on associations to indicate the number of connected objects

Once completed, the developed class diagram will provide a clear overview of the relationships and interactions between the User, Post, Like, and Comment classes, facilitating the implementation of the social media platform.

### PlantUML:
Filename: social_media_platform.puml@startuml

  - name: String
  - username: String
  - email: String
  - password: String
  + getAge(): int
}

class Post {
  - content: String
  - createdAt: Date
  - owner: User
}

class List {
  - friends : List<User>
}

class Like {
}

class Comment {
}

User "1" o--*> "many" Post : creates
User "1" o--*> "many" User : friends
Post "1" o--*> "many" Like : likedBy
Post "1" o--*> "many" Comment
Like "1" o-- "many" Post : likes
