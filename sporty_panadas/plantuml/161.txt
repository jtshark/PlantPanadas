### Request: A social media application that allows users to post pictures, videos, and text, follow other users, and comment on posts.
### Expert 1: So we need to create a UML class diagram for a social media application. We should start by identifying the main entities and their attributes.

### Expert 2: Agreed. Let's list out the main entities. We have users, posts, comments, and maybe even a separate entity for media files like pictures and videos.

### Expert 3: That sounds like a good start. Let's focus on the user entity first. What attributes would a user have?

### Expert 1: Well, we definitely need a unique identifier, such as a username or email address. We may also want to include attributes like name, email, password for account authentication.

### Expert 2: That's true. And we'll likely need some additional attributes related to the user's profile, such as a bio or a profile picture.

### Expert 3: Should we include an attribute to keep track of the number of followers for each user?

### Expert 1: Yes, that could be a good idea. It could be helpful for displaying the popularity of users.

### Expert 2: Absolutely. It might be helpful also to know the date when the user joined the platform. We could add an attribute named "registration date."

### Expert 3: Good suggestion. Another attribute that might be useful is the location of the user. We could include a "location" attribute.

### Expert 1: Great. Now let's move on to the posts entity. What attributes do you think we should include for a post?

### Expert 2: Well, a post would definitely have a unique identifier, maybe a post ID. We would also want to store the content of the post itself and a timestamp to know when the post was made.

### Expert 3: Additionally, we can include an attribute to track the number of likes or reactions a post receives. Users would appreciate seeing how many people liked a particular post.

### Expert 1: Definitely. And let's not forget about the comments. We should have an attribute for the number of comments a post has as well.

### Expert 2: Agreed. Now, how about comments? What attributes should we include for comments?

### Expert 3: Each comment should have a unique identifier, maybe a comment ID. We'll obviously need to store the comment text and a timestamp for when the comment was made.

### Expert 1: Right. We should also include an attribute to map the comment to the user who made it. Do you think we should have a separate attribute for tagging other users in the comment?

### Expert 2: It could be interesting. If we allow users to tag others in comments, having a separate user-tagged attribute would come in handy.

### Expert 3: Yes, that makes sense. It’ll allow us to keep track of tagged users easily. Let’s add that.

### Expert 1: Alright. Lastly, let's discuss the entities related to media files like pictures and videos. Should we create a separate entity for them?

### Expert 2: That could work. Each media file would likely have a unique identifier, maybe a file ID or URL. We could include attributes like the file type (picture or video), size, and description.

### Expert 3: It might also be useful to know which user uploaded the media file. We could include an attribute for that.

### Expert 1: And if we allow users to like or react to media files, we should also consider attributes for tracking the number of likes and reactions.

### Expert 2: Right. That way, we can display the popularity of media files as well.

### Expert 3: Overall, it seems like we’ve captured the key entities and their attributes for the social media application. Shall we create some relationships between these entities now?
### Instructions: Step 1: Create a class diagram 
Create a blank class diagram to start designing our social media application.

Step 2: Add User class
a. Create a User class with attributes like username, name, email, password, bio, profile picture, location, registration date, and followers count.
b. Include methods like updateUser(), deleteUser(), and viewProfile().
c. Associations: User has 0..* Posts, Comments, and MediaFiles.

Step 3: Add Post class
a. Create a Post class with attributes like postID, content, timestamp, likes/reactions count,  and comments count.
b. Include methods like addLike(), addComment(), and viewPost().
c. Associations: Post is owned by 1 User and has 0..* Comments and MediaFiles.

Step 4: Add Comment class
a. Create a Comment class with attributes such as commentID, content, timestamp, venue (@tagged users).
b. Include methods like editComment() and deleteComment().
c. Associations: Comment is made by 1 User and belongs to 1 Post.

Step 5: Add MediaFile class
a. Create a MediaFile class with attributes like fileID, fileURL, fileType, size, and description.
b. Include methods like uploadFile() and deleteFile().
c. Associations: MediaFile is owned by 1 User and belong to 1 Post.

Step 6: Define associations 
a. Add associations:
 - User has 0..* Posts, Comments, and MediaFiles.
 - Post is owned by 1 User and has 0..* Comments and MediaFiles.
 - Comment is made by 1 User and belongs to 1 Post.
 - MediaFile is owned by 1 User and belongs to 1 Post.

Step 7: Review class diagram 
Verify the class diagram design to ensure all necessary entities, attributes, and associations are represented accurately.

Note: As the class diagram focuses on a simplified visual representation of entities and their relationships, additional non-functional elements like access modifiers or business logic are excluded from this diagram.

### PlantUML:
Filename: socialmedia.puml

```
@startuml

class User {
  - username: string
  - name: string
  - email: string
  - password: string
  - bio: string
  - profilePicture: string
  - location: string
  - registrationDate: date
  - followersCount: int

  + updateUser()
  + deleteUser()
  + viewProfile()
}

class Post {
  - postID: int
  - content: string
  - timestamp: datetime
  - likesCount: int
  - commentsCount: int

  + addLike()
  + addComment()
  + viewPost()
} 

class Comment {
  - commentID: int
  - content: string
  - timestamp: datetime
  - venue: User[]

  + editComment()
  + deleteComment()
} 

class MediaFile {
  - fileID: int
  - fileURL: string
  - fileType: string
  - size: int
  - description: string

  + uploadFile()
  + deleteFile()
} 

User "0..*" *-down- "1" Post
Post "0..*" -up- "1" Comment
Comment "1" o-left- "=User"
Post "0..*" o-right- "MediaFile" 
MediaFile "1" -down- "User"

The submitted class diagram represents the main entities, attributes, and associations defined in the step-by-step instruction. It includes the User, Post, Comment, and MediaFile classes with their respective attributes and methods. The associations between the classes are also properly defined, showcasing the relationships between the entities in the social media application.
