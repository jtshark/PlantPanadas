### Request: Our project is to develop a mobile application that allows users to browse local restaurants, view menus, make reservations, and leave reviews, while restaurant owners can manage menus, reservation availability, and customer feedback.
### Expert 1: So it seems like we need to design a UML class diagram for a mobile application that connects users and restaurant owners. We'll have classes for users, restaurants, menus, reservations, and reviews. We should also define the relationships between these classes.

### Expert 2: That's correct. Let's start by identifying the basic attributes and methods for each class. The user class should at least have a username, password, and email address. Additionally, we can add methods for searching restaurants, viewing menus, making reservations, and leaving reviews.

### Expert 3: Agreed. For the restaurant class, we'll need attributes such as a name, address, and contact details. We should also include methods for managing menus, reservation availability, and customer feedback. How about the menus class? What attributes and methods do you think would fit?

### Expert 1: The menu class could have attributes such as menu items, prices, and descriptions. The methods could include adding new items, updating existing ones, and removing items. However, I'm unsure about storing the prices directly. Shouldn't we instead store the price as an attribute and provide a method to calculate any discounts or apply global changes?

### Expert 2: That's a good point. Storing just the price would make it easier to make global changes or calculations, like applying a discount to all items. Plus, it would be more practical if the prices differ between locations or time periods, we wouldn't need to have redundant data for each menu item. We could even add a method to calculate the discounted price based on the discount attribute for each item.

### Expert 3: I agree. Storing just the price and the discount would allow flexibility and reduce redundancy. Speaking of which, what about the reservation class? What attributes and methods do you think we should include?

### Expert 1: The reservation class could have attributes such as the user who made the reservation, the restaurant it's for, the date and time, and the number of guests. Additionally, we could include methods to check availability, create new reservations, and cancel existing ones. Shall we move on to the reviews class?

### Expert 2: Yes, the reviews class can have attributes such as the user who left the review, the restaurant it's for, the rating, and the comment. For methods, we can have the ability to create new reviews, update existing ones, and delete them if needed.

### Expert 3: Sounds good. Now that we have discussed the basic attributes and methods for each class, shall we move on to defining the relationships between these classes? 

### Expert 1: Before we proceed, there may be some uncertainty regarding the format of the discounts. Should we use a percentage or a fixed value for discounts on menu items? 

### QUESTION: For the discount attribute in the menu class, would you prefer a percentage or a fixed value format? 
### Answer:  I think a percentage format would work well since it would give restaurants the flexibility to more finely tune the discounts.
### Expert 2: Thank you for your response. In that case, we should use the percentage format for the discount attribute in the menu class. This will give restaurant owners the ability to easily adjust the prices based on their specific needs and preferences.

### Expert 3: Excellent, that makes sense. Now, let's discuss the relationships between the classes. It seems like there will be a relationship between the user class and the reviews class, as well as between the user class and the reservations class. A user can have multiple reviews and reservations, while each review and reservation belongs to a single user.

### Expert 1: Agreed. So we'll have a one-to-many relationship between the user class and both the reviews and reservations classes. We can represent this by drawing an arrow from the user class to the reviews and reservations classes, indicating the direction of the relationship.

### Expert 2: Additionally, there will be a relationship between the restaurant class and the menu class. Each restaurant can have multiple menus, while each menu belongs to a single restaurant. This is also a one-to-many relationship, with an arrow from the restaurant class linking to the menu class.

### Expert 3: Right. Lastly, there will be a relationship between the restaurant class and the reviews class. Each restaurant can have multiple reviews, while each review belongs to a single restaurant. This is another one-to-many relationship, with an arrow from the restaurant class to the reviews class.

### Expert 1: It seems we've covered all the major classes and their relationships. Of course, this is just the initial draft of the UML class diagram. We might discover other relationships or additional attributes/methods as we delve deeper into the project.

### Expert 2: Indeed. This is a great starting point for our UML class diagram. As we proceed, we'll likely need to further refine and update it to accurately reflect the requirements and functionality of the mobile application we're developing.

### Expert 3: Agreed. With the UML class diagram, we'll have a solid foundation to work from in terms of designing and implementing the necessary code for our mobile application. It will also help us communicate the structure and relationships of our system to other stakeholders involved in the development process.

### Expert 1: Absolutely. With a well-designed UML class diagram, we'll have a clear and organized representation of our system, making it easier to interact, test, and modify as needed.
### Instructions: Solution:

1. Start by creating a User class:
   - Add attributes: username (String), password (String), email address (String).
   - Add methods: searchRestaurants(), viewMenu(), makeReservation(), leaveReview().

2. Create a Restaurant class:
   - Add attributes: name (String), address (String), contact details (String).
   - Add methods: manageMenu(), manageReservationAvailability(), manageCustomerFeedback().

3. Create a Menu class:
   - Add attributes: menu items (List of strings), price (Decimal or Float), description (String).
   - Add methods: addItem(), updateItem(), removeItem(), calculateDiscountedPrice().

4. Create a Reservation class:
   - Add attributes: user (User object), restaurant (Restaurant object), date and time (DateTime object), number of guests (Integer).
   - Add methods: checkAvailability(), createReservation(), cancelReservation().

5. Create a Reviews class:
   - Add attributes: user (User object), restaurant (Restaurant object), rating (Integer), comment (String).
   - Add methods: createReview(), updateReview(), deleteReview().

6. Establish relationships:
   - Create a one-to-many relationship between the User class and the Reviews class (user -> reviews).
   - Create a one-to-many relationship between the User class and the Reservation class (user -> reservation).
   - Create a one-to-many relationship between the Restaurant class and the Menu class (restaurant -> menu).
   - Create a one-to-many relationship between the Restaurant class and the Reviews class (restaurant -> reviews).

Note: The above steps outline the initial design of the UML class diagram based on the given project requirements. Additional refinement and modifications can be made as necessary throughout the development process.
