### Request: Our project is about developing a website for a library, where users can search for and borrow books, view and renew their loans, and reserve upcoming releases.
### Expert 1: So, our project is to design a UML class diagram for a library website. Let's start by listing the main functionalities she has requested: searching for and borrowing books, viewing and renewing loans, and reserving upcoming releases.

### Expert 2: Right. I think we should have a main class called "Library" that represents the entire library system. Inside of it, we can have classes for books, users, loans, and reservations.

### Expert 3: That's a good start. For the "Book" class, we could have attributes like title, author, publication date, and availability. It should also have methods for loaning and reserving books.

### Expert 1: Agreed. And for the "User" class, we can include attributes like name, email, and address. It should also have methods for searching for books and renewing loans.

### Expert 2: Makes sense. We should also have a "Loan" class, with attributes like loan date, return date, and status. It should represent the loans made by users.

### Expert 3: Definitely. And we could also have a "Reservation" class for upcoming book reservations. It can store attributes like reservation date, status, and priority.

### Expert 1: I think we also need to consider how users will search for books in the library. Should we have a search method in the "Library" class or a separate class for searching?

### Expert 2: Good point. I think a separate class for searching would be more efficient. We can have a "Search" class with methods like searchByTitle, searchByAuthor, and searchByGenre. This class can interact with the "Book" class to return search results.

### Expert 3: Agreed. And when it comes to displaying loaned books or reserved books for a user, should we include a method in the "User" class or create another class for loan and reservation management?

### Expert 1: It might be more logical to have a separate class for loan and reservation management. Let's call it "LoanManager" and "ReservationManager". These classes can handle operations like renewLoan in "LoanManager" and reserveBook in "ReservationManager".

### Expert 2: That sounds better. It keeps the responsibilities separated. Also, how about a class for handling notifications for due dates, reservations, and availability status updates? We could name it "NotificationHandler".

### Expert 3: I like that idea. It would centralize all the notification-related operations. We can have methods like sendDueDateReminder, sendReservationAvailableNotification, and sendAuthorizeLoanRequest in "NotificationHandler".

### Expert 1: To summarize our design, the main classes we have discussed so far are: "Library", "Book", "User", "Loan", "Reservation", "Search", "LoanManager", "ReservationManager", and "NotificationHandler".

### Expert 2: Don't forget we also have attributes and methods for each class. We've covered some of them, but attribute wise, we'll need more details, like book genres, loan limits, and so on. Likewise, method-wise, we should define the behavior more explicitly.

### Expert 3: Right, these details will make the class diagram more comprehensive. We may need to seek clarifications from the user on these specific attributes and methods. Agreed?

### Expert 1: Completely agreed. To ensure we capture all the details accurately, let's start compiling the specific questions we need to ask the user, starting with attributes for each class.

### Expert 2: Great idea. I'll start defining the attributes we need clarity on and preface them as questions for better organization and understanding.

### Expert 3: That sounds like a solid plan. Once we have all the necessary information from the user, we can come back together to finalize the class diagram accurately.

### Expert 1: I'm glad we're on the same page. Let's begin identifying the uncertainties and listing the questions we need to ask before deepening and polishing our UML class diagram.
### Instructions: Here is a sequential step-by-step solution for designing the class diagram based on the experts' discussion:

Step 1: Create a "Library" class with necessary attributes like name and address.
Step 2: Define the "Book" class with attributes such as title, author, publication date, and availability.
Step 3: Create a "User" class with attributes like name, email, and address.
Step 4: Add a "Loan" class with attributes including loan date, return date, and status.
Step 5: Include a "Reservation" class with attributes like reservation date, status, and priority.
Step 6: Create a separate "Search" class with methods to search by title, author, and genre.
Step 7: Develop a "LoanManager" class to handle loan operations such as renewing loans.
Step 8: Add a "ReservationManager" class to handle reservation-related operations.
Step 9: Create a "NotificationHandler" class to manage and send notifications to users.
Step 10: Add necessary associations between classes (e.g., "Loan" class associating with "Book" and "User").
Step 11: Incorporate necessary attributes and methods suggested during discussion for each class.
Step 12: Identify unclarified attributes or methods and compile questions to gather missing information from the user.
Step 13: Obtain clarifications from the user on specific attributes and methods.
Step 14: Update the class diagram accordingly once all the required details are confirmed.
Step 15: Review and refine the class diagram to ensure completeness, accuracy, and overall correctness.
