### Request: I need an UML model for my project which involves building a social media app allows users to connect with each other by creating and sharing content (media, text). The app should also give users options for notifications, filtering and customizing their view.
### Expert 1: So we need to create an UML class diagram for a social media app. What are the core functionalities you think we should include?

### Expert 2: Well, we definitely need to have a User class. It should have attributes like username, email, and password for authenticating users. We can also add methods like createUser() and login() to handle user registration and authentication.

### Expert 3: Good point. Why don't we also add a Content class? It can have attributes like contentID, media, and text for the actual content being shared by the users. We can also include a creationDate attribute to track when the content was shared.

### Expert 1: That makes sense. But what about the connection between users? Should we include a class for that?

### Expert 2: I think it would be a good idea to have a Connection class. Maybe a user can have multiple connections with other users. We can include attributes like connectionID and connectionType to represent the type of connection (e.g., friend, follow, etc.).

### Expert 3: Right. And we can have methods like addConnection() and removeConnection() to manage the user's connections. We can also add methods to get the user's friends and followers.

### Expert 1: Agreed. Now, what about notifications? Should we have a separate class for that?

### Expert 2: I think it would make sense to have a Notification class. It can have attributes like notificationID, notificationType, and message to represent the details of the notification. We can also include a timestamp attribute to track when the notification was sent.

### Expert 3: That's a good idea. We can then have methods like sendNotification() and markAsRead() to manage the notifications. We can also add methods to get the user's unread notifications.

### Expert 1: Great. And what about filtering and customizing the user's view? How can we represent that in the class diagram?

### Expert 2: We can include a View class for that. It can have attributes like viewID and filterOptions to represent the user's preferred filters and customization options. We can also add methods like setFilters() and customizeView() to handle the user's preferences.

### Expert 3: Additionally, we can have a method like applyView() to actually apply the user's chosen filters and view customization to the content displayed on their screen.

### Expert 1: I like that. It keeps the representation of the user's view separate from the actual content and users. Is there anything else we should consider?

### Expert 2: Since this is a social media app, we should also think about the ability to like or comment on content. Maybe we could add a Like class and a Comment class, both connected to the Content class.

### Expert 3: Yes, we can include attributes like likeID, userID, and commentID in those classes. This will allow users to interact with the content and leave their feedback.

### Expert 1: That's a great addition. It completes the basic functionality of the social media app. Shall we start designing the UML diagram based on these ideas?
### Instructions: Solution:

Step 1: Create a User class
- Add attributes: username, email, password
- Add methods: createUser(), login()

Step 2: Create a Content class
- Add attributes: contentID, media, text, creationDate

Step 3: Create a Connection class
- Add attributes: connectionID, connectionType
- Add methods: addConnection(), removeConnection(), getFriends(), getFollowers()

Step 4: Create a Notification class
- Add attributes: notificationID, notificationType, message, timestamp
- Add methods: sendNotification(), markAsRead(), getUnreadNotifications()

Step 5: Create a View class
- Add attributes: viewID, filterOptions
- Add methods: setFilters(), customizeView(), applyView()

Step 6: Create a Like class
- Add attributes: likeID, userID

Step 7: Create a Comment class
- Add attributes: commentID, userID, text

Step 8: Connect classes with associations
- User-class has associations with Content class (indicating ownership of content)
- User-class has associations with Connection class (indicating user connection relationship)
- User-class has associations with Notification, View, Like, and Comment classes (indicating user interactions)

Step 9: Determine cardinality and multiplicity between classes
- For example, a User can have multiple Connections and multiple Notifications
- Content can be associated with multiple Users through the ownership association
- Content can have multiple Likes and Comments by Users

Step 10: Document other necessary relationships or dependencies between classes
- Evaluate if there are any dependent classes that are required for the functionality of this app. These could include authentication services, storage classes for media and texts, etc., and it is important to document their connections and interactions properly.

This sequential solution should help in the creation of the UML model for the social media app effectively.

### PlantUML:
Filename: social_media_app.puml

@startuml

class User {
  - username: string
  - email: string
  - password: string
  + createUser(): void
  + login(): void
}

class Content {
  - contentID: int
  - media: string
  - text: string
  - creationDate: datetime
}

class Connection {
  - connectionID: int
  - connectionType: string
  + addConnection(): void
  + removeConnection(): void
  + getFriends(): User[]
  + getFollowers(): User[]
}

class Notification {
  - notificationID: int
  - notificationType: string
  - message: string
  - timestamp: datetime
  + sendNotification(): void
  + markAsRead(): void
  + getUnreadNotifications(): Notification[]
}

class View {
  - viewID: int
  - filterOptions: string
  + setFilters(): void
  + customizeView(): void
  + applyView(): void
}

class Like {
  - likeID: int
  - userID: int
}

class Comment {
  - commentID: int
  - userID: int
  - text: string
}

User "1" -- "1..*" Content : owns
User "0..*" -- Connection : has
User "0..*" -- Notification : has
User "0..*" -- View : has
User "0..*" -- "0..*" Like
Content "1" -- "0..*" Like
Content "1" -- "0..*" Comment
