### Request: Our project is an online bookstore where customers can search for books, purchase them, and leave reviews, while system administrators manage the book inventory and user management.
### Expert 1: So, we are tasked with designing a UML class diagram for an online bookstore. We need to consider functionalities like book searching, purchasing, reviews, book inventory management, and user management. Where would you suggest we start?

### Expert 2: We should create separate classes for books, customers, system administrators, and reviews. These would be the main entities in our system.

### Expert 3: I agree with ### Expert 2. Let's start with the Book class. It should include attributes such as book title, author, ISBN, price, publication year, and any other relevant information.

### Expert 1: Book reviews are also a significant part of our system. We should add a Review class that includes attributes like the reviewer's name, rating, and comments.

### Expert 3: Agree. And while we're at it, let's add a Customer class to represent users who purchase books. This should include their name, email, and any additional information needed for tracking. We should also add an Administrator class to represent system administrators.

### Expert 2: That sounds good. We also need to consider the functionality relating to book search and purchase. We should include methods in our classes to support these operations.

### Expert 1: Definitely. For example, in the Book class, we can have a searchByTitle method that takes a keyword as input, searches for books with matching titles, and returns the results.

### Expert 2: We will also need a processPurchase method in the Customer class, which takes a Book object as input and handles the purchase transaction.

### Expert 3: Agreed. And don't forget the getReviews method in the Book class. This method would return a list of Review objects associated with a certain book.

### Expert 1: Makes sense. Adding a getReviews method will facilitate retrieving reviews for a particular book and displaying them on the bookstore's website.

### Expert 2: Now, let's think about how to handle the book inventory. Each Book object will need an attribute to represent the quantity available.

### Expert 3: That's correct. We should also consider how to handle user management. What attributes and methods do you think we should include?

### Expert 1: For user management, we may need to include attributes like username, password, and role (such as regular customer or administrator) in the Customer and Administrator classes.

### Expert 2: I agree. We should include a method in the Administrator class that allows them to add, update, and remove books from the inventory.

### Expert 3: And let's not forget to consider the relationships between these classes. For example, reviews are associated with specific books, so there would be an association between the Review and Book classes.

### Expert 1: That's right. And customers can purchase multiple books, so there would be an association between the Customer and Book classes as well.

### Expert 2: Good points. Now we have covered the main functionalities and entities of the system. The next step would be to review the class diagram, making sure all the relationships, attributes, and methods accurately represent the user's requirements.

### Expert 1: Agreed. We could also seek clarification from the user if there are any ambiguities or uncertainties in the requirements.

### Expert 3: Great. Let's finalize the diagram, resolve any doubts, and ensure that it encompasses all necessary functionalities. Then we can proceed with implementing the system accordingly.
### Instructions: Solution:

Step 1: Create a Book class with attributes:
- title: string
- author: string
- ISBN: string
- price: double
- publicationYear: int

Step 2: Create a Review class with attributes:
- reviewerName: string
- rating: int
- comments: string

Step 3: Create a Customer class with attributes:
- name: string
- email: string

Step 4: Create an Administrator class with attributes:
- name: string
- username: string
- password: string

Step 5: Add methods to the Book class:
- searchByTitle(keyword: string): List<Book>
- getTotalStock(): int
- getReviews(): List<Review>

Step 6: Add methods to the Customer class:
- processPurchase(book: Book): void

Step 7: Add methods to the Administrator class:
- addBook(book: Book): void
- updateBook(book: Book): void
- removeBook(book: Book): void

Step 8: In the Review class, create an association to the Book class:
- book: Book

Step 9: In the Customer class, create an association to the Book class:
- purchasedBooks: List<Book>

Step 10: Optionally, add attributes to the Customer and Administrator classes related to user management, like role:
- role: string

Step 11: Optionally, add attributes to the Book class to handle inventory:
- quantityAvailable: int

Step 12: Now review the class diagram and ensure that the relationships, attributes, and methods accurately represent the customer requirements.

Note: This solution presents the basic structure of the class diagram for the given requirements. Depending on additional requirements or project scope, you can further refine the class diagram accordingly.

### PlantUML:
Filename: online_bookstore.puml
```plantuml
@startuml
class Book {
    - title: string
    - author: string
    - ISBN: string
    - price: double
    - publicationYear: int
    + searchByTitle(keyword: string): List<Book>
    + getTotalStock(): int
    + getReviews(): List<Review>
}

class Review {
    - reviewerName: string
    - rating: int
    - comments: string
    + Review(book: Book)
}

class Customer {
    - name: string
    - email: string
    + processPurchase(book: Book): void
    * purchasedBooks: List<Book>
}

class Administrator {
    - name: string
    - username: string
    - password: string
    + addBook(book: Book): void
    + updateBook(book: Book): void
    + removeBook(book: Book): void
}

class User {
    - username: string
    - password: string
}

Book --|> Review
Book --> User
Review --> Book
Customer --> Book
Administrator --> Book
Administrator --> User
@enduml
```

Note: In this class diagram, the User class is introduced to handle general user attributes and methods, which is then inherited by both the Customer and Administrator classes.
