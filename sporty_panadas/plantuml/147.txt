### Request: Our project is to design a website for our online store, where customers can browse and purchase products, while the store owner can add and manage products, process orders, and track delivery information.
### Expert 1: So, for the online store website, we need to create a UML class diagram to represent the different components and their relationships. 

### Expert 2: Right. Let's start by identifying the main components we'll need. We have customers, products, orders, and delivery information.

### Expert 3: Yes, those are the main entities involved in the system. We should represent them as classes in our diagram.

### Expert 1: I agree. We should also consider any specific attributes that need to be associated with each class. For example, for the 'Product' class, we may need to include attributes like name, price, and quantity.

### Expert 2: That's a good point. And for the 'Customer' class, we can include attributes like name, address, and contact information.

### Expert 3: Right, and for the 'Order' class, we'll need to include attributes like order date, product list, and total amount.

### Expert 1: Another thing we need to consider is the relationships between these classes. For example, an order is associated with a customer, so we need to show that connection.

### Expert 2: Absolutely. We can represent this using an association relation between the 'Order' and 'Customer' classes. Additionally, an order can have multiple products, which suggests a composition relationship between the 'Order' and 'Product' classes.

### Expert 3: That's correct. And when it comes to managing products, perhaps we should introduce a separate class called 'StoreOwner' with its own attributes and methods for adding and managing products.

### Expert 1: Agreed. This way, the 'StoreOwner' class can have an association relationship with the 'Product' class to indicate that it has control over the product data.

### Expert 2: We should also consider the delivery process. Would it make sense to have a separate 'Delivery' class to track delivery information?

### Expert 3: Yes, that seems reasonable. A 'Delivery' class can include attributes like delivery date, carrier information, and status. We can establish an association relationship between the 'Delivery' and 'Order' classes to reflect that connection.

### Expert 1: That would work. Now, something to consider is how to handle the pricing of products. Should we store a separate price and discounted price, or should we introduce a discount concept to calculate the final price?

### Expert 2: It would be more logical to have a separate attribute for price and a 'Discount' class with attributes like percentage or amount. Then we can create a method in the 'Product' class called 'getDiscountedPrice' that calculates the final price taking the discount into account.

### Expert 3: That makes sense. By encapsulating the discount logic within the 'Product' class, we can easily update and maintain it.

### Expert 1: Another consideration is handling the age of the customers. Instead of directly storing the age as an attribute, it's often better to save the date of birth and then have a method called 'getAge'.

### Expert 2: Absolutely. Calculating the age based on the date of birth ensures that the information remains accurate without needing regular updates.

### Expert 3: And while we're on the topic of attributes, what should we do with the images of the products? Should we store them directly in the 'Product' class?

### Expert 1: It may not be efficient to store images in the class itself, considering the potential size and number of images. Instead, we should store the file path or URL pointing to each image.

### Expert 2: I agree. That way, we would save valuable storage space and be able to organize and manage the images separately.

### Expert 3: Great suggestion. By storing the image references, we can optimize the performance while efficiently connecting them with the corresponding products.

### Expert 1: It seems like we have a clear understanding of the necessary class structure for the online store website. Let's ensure we capture all these details correctly in the UML class diagram.

### Expert 2: Good plan. We'll assign the relevant attributes, methods, and relationships to each class in order to represent the system accurately and effectively.

### Expert 3: When designing the diagram, we must also keep in mind that it may evolve during the development process. We should make it flexible enough to accommodate any future modifications.

### Expert 1: Absolutely. Keeping a modular design will facilitate maintenance, scalability, and enhancements as the website evolves over time. 

### Expert 2: Agreed. By considering real-world scenarios and carefully designing the UML class diagram, we can ensure that our system accurately reflects the needs of both the store owner and the customers.

### Expert 3: This is where we can consult with the user to clarify any ambiguities, seek their input, and make sure we're on the right track with our design. This way, we can provide them with a solution that meets their requirements efficiently.
### Instructions: Step-by-step Solution:

Step 1: Start by creating the following classes:

- Customer
- Product
- Order
- Delivery
- StoreOwner
- Discount

Step 2: Define attributes for each class:

Customer:
- name
- address
- contact information
- date of birth (DateTime)

Product:
- name
- price
- quantity
- image reference (string/URL)

Order:
- order date (DateTime)
- product list (list of Product objects)
- total amount

Delivery:
- delivery date (DateTime)
- carrier information
- status

StoreOwner:
- No specific attributes required - this class will mainly handle methods for managing products

Discount:
- percentage or amount (depending on the discount method chosen)

Step 3: Implement association relationships between classes:

- Customer class and Order class have an association relationship.
- Order class and Product class have a composition relationship.
- Delivery class and Order class have an association relationship.
- StoreOwner class and Product class have an association relationship.

Step 4: Create necessary methods within classes:

- For Product class: 
  - getDiscountedPrice method that calculates the final price based on the discount applied.
  
- For Customer class:
  - getAge method that calculates and returns the age based on the date of birth attribute.
  
- For StoreOwner class:
  - createProduct method for adding new products.
  - updateProduct method for modifying existing products.
  - deleteProduct method for removing products.

Step 5: Finalize the UML class diagram with proper attribute and method associations.

The resulting UML class diagram should accurately represent the structure, relationships, and functionality of the online store system, providing an overview of the classes, their attributes, their relationships, and the methods they possess.

### PlantUML:
Filename: UML_Class_Diagram_Online_Store.puml
```
@startuml

class Customer {
  - name: String
  - address: String
  - contact information: String
  - date of birth: DateTime
  + calculateAge(): int
}

class Product {
  - name: String
  - price: double
  - quantity: int
  - image reference: String/URL
  + getDiscountedPrice(): double
}

class Order {
  - order date: DateTime
  - product list: List of Product objects
  - total amount: double
}

class Delivery {
  - delivery date: DateTime
  - carrier information: String
  - status: String
}

class StoreOwner {
  <<singleton>> 
  --Unique instance--
  â€“
  +'Instance': singleTone_Instance
  ...
  __________________________________Note: No need attribute, because only have system controllers ('Instance')
+addProduct()
    ~all() 
    ...

}

class Discount {
  - amount: double
  // or
  // - percentage: double
}
