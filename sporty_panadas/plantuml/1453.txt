### Request: My project is to create a new social networking app that enables users to create profiles, connect with friends, share photos, and chat one-on-one or in groups. It should also include a notification system that alerts users of new messages or friend requests.
### Expert 1: So, it seems like we have a fun project ahead! Our user wants to create a social networking app with user profiles, friend connections, photo sharing, one-on-one and group chat, and a notification system. We will need to design a class diagram to represent these functionalities. 

### Expert 2: First off, we should identify the main entities in our system. I think we would need a "User" class to represent each user's profile. This class would contain attributes like name, age, date of birth, and email. It should also have methods such as addFriend and removeFriend to manage the friends' connections.

### Expert 3: I agree with that. Let's also include an "Image" class to handle photo sharing. Each object of this class will have attributes such as the photo's file name, description, date and time it was uploaded, and maybe even the user who uploaded it. We can implement methods to upload, view, and delete photos.

### Expert 1: Sounds good. Now, for messaging, I think we should have a "Message" class. Each object of this class will contain attributes like the sender, recipient(s), message content, and date/time sent. We could also include methods like sendMessage and deleteMessage.

### Expert 2: That makes sense. We probably also need a separate class for the notification system. Let's call it "Notification". Each notification can have attributes like the recipient(s), content, type (friend request, message alert, etc.), and date/time received. We can add methods to send notifications and mark them as read.

### Expert 3: Yes, we can also have a "Group" class to handle group chats. This class will have attributes like the group members, conversation history, and a name or ID. It should support methods to create a group, add/remove members, and send messages within the group chat.

### Expert 1: Agreed. We should also include a "FriendRequest" class to handle friend requests between users. Each object from this class can contain the sender and the receiver. We may need methods like sendFriendRequest and acceptFriendRequest.

### Expert 2: Furthermore, let's not forget to handle authentication and user login/signup. We could assign a "Credential" class for that. It will have attributes to store the username and password ane should support methods like authenticate and changePassword.

### Expert 3: That's essential. By the way, should we consider having a "Comment" class for the photos, messages, and friend requests? Each comment instance might have attributes like the content, date/time, and the user who made the comment. We can implement methods to post comments and delete them if necessary.

### Expert 1: Great idea! Adding a Comment class would increase flexibility. 

### Expert 2: Agreed. I think that covers most of the necessary classes and functionalities for our social networking app. However, we should now go over the diagram together and make sure all the relationships between classes are properly established.

### Expert 3: Absolutely. Let's review the connections to ensure they accurately represent the user request and the system's logic. We may come up with additional attributes or methods and update the diagram accordingly.

(### Experts start finalizing the UML class diagram)
### Instructions: Solution:

1. Create a "User" class with attributes like name, age, date of birth, and email.

2. Add methods to the "User" class such as addFriend(user) and removeFriend(user) to manage friend connections.

3. Create an "Image" class with attributes including the file name, description, upload date/time, and possibly the user who uploaded it.

4. Implement upload, view, and delete methods in the "Image" class.

5. Create a "Message" class with attributes like sender, recipient(s), message content, and date/time sent.

6. Add functions to the "Message" class such as sendMessage and deleteMessage.

7. Code a "Notification" class with attributes including the recipient(s), content, type (friend request, message alert, etc.), and date/time received.

8. Implement methods in the "Notification" class to send notifications and mark them as read.

9. Create a "Group" class to handle group chats, with attributes like group members, conversation history, and a name or ID.

10. Include methods in the "Group" class to create a group, add/remove members, and send messages within the group chat.

11. Design and create a "FriendRequest" class with attributes like sender and receiver.

12. Implement methods like sendFriendRequest and acceptFriendRequest in the "FriendRequest" class.

13. Create a "Credential" class to handle authentication and user login/signup processes, with attributes for username and password.

14. Add methods to the "Credential" class like authenticate and changePassword.

15. Consider adding a "Comment" class with attributes including content, date/time, and the user who made the comment for photos, messages, and friend requests.

16. Implement methods to post comments and delete them if necessary in the "Comment" class.

17. Review the overall diagram to ensure all connections are accurately represented and that each class has appropriate attributes and methods based on the discussed requirements.

18. Analyze the need for any additional functionalities or attributes in the existing classes and update the diagram accordingly.
