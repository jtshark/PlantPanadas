### Request: I want to build a website that allows users to create online quizzes and share them with their peers while keeping track of the user's results and responses.
### Expert 1: So, our user wants a website that allows them to create online quizzes and share them with others. We also need to keep track of the user's results and responses. We'll need to design a UML class diagram to meet these requirements. Any initial thoughts, team?

### Expert 2: Yes, we would definitely need a class for the Quiz. It should have attributes like quizID, title, description, and creatorUserID. We'll also need methods for creating, editing, and deleting the quiz.

### Expert 3: Agreed. And to keep track of the questions in each quiz, we'll need another class called Question. Each Quiz object will have multiple Question objects associated with it. We can add attributes like questionID, questionText, options, and answer to the Question class.

### Expert 1: That makes sense. We also need to track the users' responses, right? Should we have a separate class for that?

### Expert 2: Yes, we should. Let's call it Response. It can have attributes like responseID, userID, quizID, questionID, and answer. It will represent an individual user's response to a specific question in a particular quiz.

### Expert 3: And we need to be able to track which users have attempted which quizzes. So, we'll have a class called UserQuizAttempt. It can have attributes like userID, quizID, and attemptDate. This way, we can keep a log of each user's attempts on different quizzes.

### Expert 1: Great! But how do we share the quizzes with other users? Should we introduce a class for that?

### Expert 2: That's a good point. We probably need a class called QuizShare. It can have attributes like quizID, sharedUserID, and shareDate. This will allow us to keep track of which quizzes were shared with which users and when.

### Expert 3: Agreed. Additionally, we may want a class called User, which represents each individual user of the website. It can have attributes like userID, username, and password. This will simplify authentication and accessibility.

### Expert 1: Indeed. And we should define the relationships between these classes: Quiz will have a composition relationship with Question as a Quiz can have multiple Questions. Response will have an association relationship with User, Question, and Quiz as it relates to users' responses. UserQuizAttempt will also have an association relationship with User and Quiz. Finally, QuizShare will have an association relationship with User and Quiz.

### Expert 2: Makes sense. Are there any other requirements we need to consider?

### Expert 3: One thing that comes to mind is the need to track the high scores for each quiz. Should we also include a Score class with attributes like quizID, userID, and score?

### Expert 1: I think that would be a good addition. It would allow us to store and display the highest scores achieved by users in each quiz.

### Expert 2: Agreed. This would encourage competition among the users and motivate them to continue using the platform. It could also serve as a way to recognize outstanding performance.

### Expert 3: Alright, so we'll add the Score class with attributes quizID, userID, and score, and its association with User and Quiz. I think that covers it.

### Expert 1: Let's go ahead and visualize this in a UML class diagram to see if everything fits together seamlessly.
### Instructions: Step-by-step solution for designing the UML class diagram:

1. Create a class called Quiz with the following attributes:
   - quizID: String
   - title: String
   - description: String
   - creatorUserID: String

2. Create methods for the Quiz class to perform actions such as creating, editing, and deleting quizzes.

3. Create a class called Question with the following attributes:
   - questionID: String
   - questionText: String
   - options: Array
   - answer: String

4. Associate the Question class with the Quiz class using a composition relationship. A Quiz has multiple Questions.

5. Create a class called Response with the following attributes:
   - responseID: String
   - userID: String
   - quizID: String
   - questionID: String
   - answer: String

6. Associate the Response class with the User, Quiz, and Question classes using association relationships. Responses relate to users' answers for specific questions in certain quizzes.

7. Create or use an existing class called User with the following attributes:
   - userID: String
   - username: String
   - password: String

8. Create a class called UserQuizAttempt with the following attributes:
   - userID: String
   - quizID: String
   - attemptDate: Date

9. Associate the UserQuizAttempt class with the User and Quiz classes using association relationships. UserQuizAttempts relate to specific users' attempts on different quizzes.

10. Create a class called QuizShare with the following attributes:
   - quizID: String
   - sharedUserID: String
   - shareDate: Date

11. Associate the QuizShare class with the User and Quiz classes using association relationships. QuizShares track which quizzes were shared with which users and when.

12. If desired, create a class called Score with the following attributes:
   - quizID: String
   - userID: String
   - score: int

13. Associate the Score class with the User and Quiz classes using an association relationship. Scores store the highest achieved scores by users in each quiz.

14. Review the created UML class diagram to ensure all classes, attributes, and associations are designed correctly.

The experts should follow these steps realistically, considering the accounting and acknowledging possible issues, performing checks, among other acts of professionalism.

class QuizShare {
  - quizID: String
  - sharedUserID: String
  - shareDate: Date
}

class Score {
  - quizID: String
  - userID: String
  - score: int
}
