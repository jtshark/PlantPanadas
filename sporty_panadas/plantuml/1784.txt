### Request: Create a UML model for a mobile app that allows users to track their daily water intake and set reminders for drinking water, as well as view their progress towards their daily goal.
### Expert 1: So, to begin with, we should have a "User" class to represent the app's users, right?
### Expert 2: Yes, the "User" class would definitely be necessary. It would contain attributes like "username," "email," and "password" for authentication purposes.
### Expert 3: Agreed. Additionally, we could include an attribute like "dailyWaterIntakeGoal" to store the user's desired daily intake goal.
### Expert 1: Excellent observation! Now, we need to create a class that tracks the actual water intake. Let's call it "WaterTracker." This class should have an association with the "User" class, indicating that each user has one "WaterTracker" associated with them.
### Expert 2: Good idea. The "WaterTracker" class can have an attribute like "totalWaterIntake" to keep track of how much water a user drinks throughout the day.
### Expert 3: Additionally, we should include a method in the "WaterTracker" class called "addWaterIntake" that allows the user to log the amount of water they drink.
### Expert 1: Makes sense. We should also indicate that the "User" class has a method called "setReminder" so users can set reminders for drinking water at specific intervals.
### Expert 2: Agreed. It'll be helpful if we include an attribute in the "User" class called "reminderInterval" to store the time interval between reminders. This way, reminders can be personalized to the user's preferences.
### Expert 3: Great. Now, it would be useful if the "User" class had a method to calculate the percentage of completed water intake towards the set goal. Let's name it "calculateCompletionPercentage".
### Expert 1: Yes, perfect. Oh, I just thought of something. Maybe we should add some kind of notification feature too.
### Expert 2: That's a good point. We could create a separate class called "Notification" that would have an association with the "User" class to indicate that each user receives notifications.
### Expert 3: The "Notification" class could have attributes like "notificationMessage" and "notificationTime." This way, users would know when and why they're receiving notifications about their water intake progress.
### Expert 1: Absolutely. I think we have covered the basic structure of the class diagram. To summarize, we've added the "WaterTracker" class to track water intake, the method "setReminder" in the "User" class, the method "addWaterIntake" in the "WaterTracker" class, and the "calculateCompletionPercentage" method in the "User" class.
### Expert 2: Yes, and the "Notification" class to handle notifications. It's always best to clarify requirements with the end-users directly. Shall we present this proposed diagram to the user and seek their feedback?
### Expert 3: Definitely. Client feedback is crucial for refining our model. ### QUESTION: Should the User class have any additional attributes besides username, email, password, dailyWaterIntakeGoal, and reminderInterval? 
### Answer: 
Yes, additional attributes that should be included in the User class include 'dailyCaloriesIntakeGoal' and 'activityLevel' to track caloric intake and physical activity respectively.
### Expert 1: Thank you for the additional information. We will include the attributes 'dailyCaloriesIntakeGoal' and 'activityLevel' in the User class to track the user's caloric intake goal and activity level. Is there anything else we should include in the model to meet your requirements?
### Expert 2: Also, we could consider adding a method in the User class to calculate the user's caloric intake progress towards their goal, just like we did for the water intake goal. Would that be helpful as well?
### Expert 3: I agree. Having a method in the User class called 'calculateCaloricIntakePercentage' would allow users to easily see how well they are meeting their caloric intake goal.
### Expert 1: Indeed. It seems like we've covered all the necessary components in the model now. The User class will have the additional attributes 'dailyCaloriesIntakeGoal' and 'activityLevel'. Plus, we'll include the method 'calculateCaloricIntakePercentage'. Thank you for the clarification.
### Instructions: Step-by-step Solution:
1. Create a class called "User" with the following attributes:
   - username: String
   - email: String
   - password: String
   - dailyWaterIntakeGoal: double
   - reminderInterval: int
   - dailyCaloriesIntakeGoal: int
   - activityLevel: String
	
2. Create a class called "WaterTracker" with the following attributes:
   - totalWaterIntake: double

3. Add an association between the "User" and "WaterTracker" classes with a cardinality of 1 to 1.

4. Add a method called "addWaterIntake" to the "WaterTracker" class, which takes a "double" parameter representing the amount of water consumed.

5. Add a method called "calculateCompletionPercentage" to the "User" class to calculate the percentage of completed water intake towards the set goal.

6. Create a class called "Notification" with the following attributes:
   - notificationMessage: String
   - notificationTime: Date

7. Add an association between the "User" and "Notification" classes with a cardinality of 0 to *.

8. Add a method called "setReminder" to the "User" class for setting reminders to drink water at specific intervals.

9. Create a method called "calculateCaloricIntakePercentage" in the "User" class to calculate the percentage of completed caloric intake towards the set goal.
	
10. Ensure that you have proper visibility settings for class attributes and methods (e.g., private, public) according to the access requirements.

Remember to consult with the client, provide them with the proposed class diagram, and obtain their feedback before proceeding with the implementation.

Filename: mobile_app_water_intake.puml

@startuml

class User {
  - username: String
  - email: String
  - password: String
  - dailyWaterIntakeGoal: double
  - reminderInterval: int
  - dailyCaloriesIntakeGoal: int
  - activityLevel: String
  
  + setReminder(): void
  + calculateCompletionPercentage(): double
  + calculateCaloricIntakePercentage(): double
}

class WaterTracker {
  - totalWaterIntake: double
  
  + addWaterIntake(amount: double): void
}

class Notification {
  - notificationMessage: String
  - notificationTime: Date
}

User "1" -- "1" WaterTracker
