### Request: Our project is creating a plan for a new shopping website where customers can search and browse products, and add items to their cart before proceeding to payment.
### Expert 1: So, we're tasked with designing a UML class diagram for a shopping website. To start, we should identify the main entities involved. Obviously, we have Customers and Products. Any other entities come to mind?

### Expert 2: How about Carts? Customers need a way to add items to their cart before checking out, right?

### Expert 3: Yes, that makes sense. We can also include an Order class, which will represent the final purchase made by the customer.

### Expert 1: Great, so we have Customers, Products, Carts, and Orders. Now we need to define the attributes and behaviors for each of these classes.

### Expert 2: For the Customer class, I think we should include attributes like name, email, and address. We'll also need some way for customers to authenticate themselves with a username and password.

### Expert 3: Agreed. Along with those, we should also consider including an account balance for tracking their available funds.

### Expert 1: Good point. In terms of behaviors, we might want methods for updating their personal information and checking their account balance.

### Expert 2: Moving on to the Product class, we should include attributes like name, price, and quantity available.

### Expert 3: Absolutely. For behaviors, we can add methods to retrieve and update the quantity available, as well as get the overall price based on the quantity.

### Expert 1: Alright, next up is the Cart class. We should definitely include a list of products as one of the attributes. What do you think?

### Expert 2: Definitely. This list will allow users to add or remove products from their cart. But how about incorporating a price attribute for the cart too? That way, we know the total cost of the items in the cart.

### Expert 3: Agreed. It would be helpful to calculate that total price and also maybe include a method to clear the cart after placing an order.

### Expert 1: Makes sense. Finally, the Order class. I think we should include attributes for the customer who placed the order, an order ID, and a status to track whether the order is pending, confirmed, or delivered.

### Expert 2: That sounds good. And how about a method to calculate the total price of the order by summing up all the product prices in the cart?

### Expert 3: That seems logical. We can also include a method to get the delivery status of the order based on the status attribute.

### Expert 1: Sounds good. Let's summarize what we have so far and ensure we haven't missed anything. We've covered Customers, Products, Carts, and Orders and defined their attributes and behaviors.

### Expert 2: I think we have a pretty solid foundation. Although, I do have a question for the user regarding the Cart-class. Shall I ask?

### Expert 1: Sure, feel free to ask. Please follow the question format we discussed earlier.

### Expert 2: ### QUESTION: Are there any additional features or requirements for the Cart class that we should consider? 
### Answer:  Yes! We would like to be able to include Promo codes and Discounts applied on the total sum. This should be reflected in the calculations for the cart and order classes.
### Expert 1: Ah, that sounds interesting! We should definitely accommodate promo codes and discounts in our UML class diagram.

### Expert 2: To handle promo codes, we can add a attribute to the Cart class representing the applied promo code. And perhaps another attribute in the Order class to represent the promo code used for the finalized order.

### Expert 3: Good idea. As for discounts, we can add an attribute to the Product class for the discount amount. This way, the price attribute would represent the original price. Then, we can have a getDiscountedPrice() method in the Product class to calculate the discounted price.

### Expert 1: I agree. That way, each Product object will retain its original price but has a method to retrieve the discounted price if applicable. We can use this method while calculating the total cart price and the order price.

### Expert 3: Exactly. This approach allows us the flexibility to update discounts easily without affecting the original price. But, out of curiosity, should we also consider the possibility of having multiple discounts or multiple promo codes applied simultaneously? It might be unlikely, but worth checking for clarification.

### Expert 2: It's a good point. Let me seek clarification on this to finalize our design:

### QUESTION: Can there be multiple promo codes or multiple discounts applied simultaneously in the Cart or Order? Or is it expected that only one promo code and one discount will be applied at a time?
### Answer:  Only one promo code and one discount can be applied at a time.
### Expert 1: Thank you for clarifying that. So, we'll stick with the design of having one promo code and one discount for the cart and order classes. This helps maintain simplicity in the system.

### Expert 2: That makes sense. I think we have a clear understanding now. We can update our UML class diagram accordingly, adding the necessary attributes and methods for promo codes and discounts.

### Expert 3: Agreed. Let's incorporate these changes into the class diagram, representing the promo code and discount attributes and the corresponding methods to calculate the pricing with discounts applied.

### Expert 1: Excellent. Once we have the updated class diagram, we can proceed with the implementation phase with a clear design.

### Expert 2: Absolutely. Incorporating promo codes and discounts will add value to the shopping experience while maintaining our system's flexibility. I'm excited to see it come together.

### Expert 3: Me too. It's gratifying to know that we are catering to various customer needs and accommodating their preferences effectively. Let's finalize the changes now and get ready for the next steps.

(Note: The experts continue their discussion, making any further necessary inquiries or refinements to the UML class diagram based on the user's requirements and use case of the shopping website.)
### Instructions: Here is the step-by-step solution for designing the UML class diagram for the shopping website, considering all the discussed elements, such as promo codes, discounts, and their impacts on the cart and order classes:

1. Start by creating the Customer class with the following attributes:
   - name: string
   - email: string
   - address: string
   - username: string
   - password: string
   - accountBalance: float

2. Next is the Product class, which will include the following attributes:
   - name: string
   - price: float
   - quantityAvailable: int
   - discount: float

   Additionally, create a method called getDiscountedPrice() that calculates the price after applying the discount.

3. Add the Cart class with the following attributes:
   - customer: Customer
   - products: List<Product>
   - promoCode: string

   Include methods to addProduct(product: Product) and removeProduct(product: Product) that manipulate the products list. You can also include getCartPrice() to calculate the total cart price, considering item quantity, prices, and discounts. 

4. Create the Order class containing these attributes:
   - customer: Customer
   - products: List<Product>
   - promoCode: string
   - orderID: string
   - status: string

   Define a getPriceWithPromoCode() method to calculate the price when a promo code is applied.

5. To represent the one-to-many relationship between Customer and Cart, create an association from Customer to Cart with the multiplicity of "1" for Customer and "*" (many) for Cart.

6. Create another association between Cart and Product to signify that a Cart can have multiple Products and that each Product can be a part of multiple Carts. Set the multiplicity to "*" at both ends.

7. Similarly, connect Product and Order with an association representing the multiplicity of "*" at both ends, allowing multiple products to be a part of multiple orders.

8. Make an association between Customer and Order, indicating that one Customer can have multiple Orders while restricting Orders to one customer.

9. Finally, incorporate the association between Cart and Order with the multiplicity of "1" for Cart and "*" (many) for Order, signifying that multiple carts can lead to multiple orders.

That concludes our step-by-step solution for creating a class diagram of a shopping website featuring customers, products, carts, and orders, along with the addition of promo codes and discounts.
