### Request: Our project is a website where users can build and customize their wedding registry, and share it with their family and friends. The website should also allow vendors to showcase and sell wedding-related products and services.
### Expert 1: So our main user request is to design a UML class diagram for a wedding registry website, right?

### Expert 2: Yes, and it should also support vendors showcasing and selling their wedding-related products and services. We'll need to consider both user and vendor functionalities.

### Expert 3: Precisely. Firstly, we need to identify the main entities involved. We can start with the obvious ones like User, Vendor, and Product. In addition, we want to include features like building and customizing a registry, sharing it, and potentially purchasing items as well. 

### Expert 1: That sounds about right. Let's further explore the relationships and attributes of each entity. For the User entity, we should include properties like Name, Email, and password.

### Expert 2: I think we should also consider including user-generated content, such as their registry preferences or a list of previously purchased items. It can help personalize the experience for them 

### Expert 3: That's a good point. Including a Date Of Birth attribute could be beneficial too; then we can have a corresponding getAge() method in the User class that calculates the current age of the user. Plus, storing age directly might become problematic if we need accurate data in the future.

### Expert 1: Agreed. We need to consider the flexibility of the information stored. 

### Expert 2: When it comes to the Vendor entity, we should include properties like Name, Email, Password, and maybe even a Vendor ID so that we have a unique identifier for each vendor.

### Expert 3: Additionally, we could have attributes like Products, Services, and Ratings. And we can define relationships between the Vendor and Product entities by having a one-to-many association.

### Expert 1: Definitely. The Product entity should have attributes like Name, Description, Price, and maybe even a Discount attribute. We could also have methods like getDiscountedPrice() to calculate the price after applying the discount.

### Expert 2: I agree. Storing discount separately allows for more flexibility in case discounts change or are updated frequently.

### Expert 3: Right. A Vendor could have multiple products and services, creating a one-to-many relationship between Vendor and Product entities. And the Product cl
### Instructions: Here is a step-by-step solution for creating the UML class diagram for the wedding registry website:

1. Create a class called "User" with attributes like Name, Email, Password, and Date of Birth.
2. Add a method in the User class called getAge() to calculate the current age based on the Date of Birth. 

3. Create a class called "Vendor" with attributes like Name, Email, Password, and Vendor ID.
4. Add attributes like Products, Services, and Ratings to the Vendor class.

5. Create a class called "Product" with attributes like Name, Description, Price, and Discount.
6. Add a method called getDiscountedPrice() in the Product class to calculate the price after applying the discount.

7. Establish associations between the classes:
   - User has a one-to-many association with Product, representing the user's registry items.
   - Vendor has a one-to-many association with Product, representing the products offered by the vendor.

8. Add an association between User and Vendor, representing the relationship between users and the vendors they select for their registry.

9. Include any additional classes or features as necessary, like a separate class for Order to represent the purchases made by users.

10. Once the class diagram is complete, review it to ensure all relationships and attributes are accurately represented.

That concludes the step-by-step solution for designing the UML class diagram for the wedding registry website.
