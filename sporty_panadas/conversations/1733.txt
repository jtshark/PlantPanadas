### Request: Our project involves developing a social media platform where users can post and share content, follow other users, and communicate through direct messaging.
### Expert 1: Wow, that sounds like an interesting project. To start designing our UML class diagram, we should identify the main entities in this social media platform. I think we'll need classes for User, Post, Follow, and Message. 
### Expert 2: I agree, those classes cover the basic functionalities of the platform. Let's start with the User class. We'll need attributes like username, email, password, and profile picture. Any other attributes come to mind?
### Expert 3: How about a attribute for the user's bio or description? It could be a short text where they can introduce themselves to others on the platform. Also, should we include a method to retrieve the number of followers a user has?
### Expert 1: Good point. Including a bio attribute would give users the opportunity to express themselves. As for the getFollowersCount method, I think that's a good idea, but wouldn't it be better to calculate it dynamically rather than storing it as an attribute? That way, the count would always be up to date.
### Expert 2: Agreed. In case of frequent changes in followers, calculating it dynamically makes more sense. User's follower count sometimes changes multiple times we wouldn't want outdated information. Besides, it will handle cases where user's following limit increases beyond the storage attribute capacity.
### Expert 3: Makes sense. So we'll remove the followersCount attribute and replace it with a getFollowersCount() method that retrieves the count of a user's followers at runtime. Anything else we should consider for the User class?
### Expert 1: How about a setName() method to update the user's name? That way, if a user decides to change their name, it can be easily updated.
### Expert 2: Good addition. The setName() method will make it convenient for users to update their associated name without having to go through any complex steps. Are there any other attributes or methods we need to include in the User class?
### Expert 3: We should also include savePost() method in user class as user creates and save their own post. It will allow users to store their posts and retrieve them easily.
### Expert 1: Good catch. The savePost() method will definitely be a handy feature for users to store their own posts conveniently. Now that we have covered the User class, should we move on to the Post class?
### Expert 2: Absolutely. Let's talk about the attributes the Post class should include. Obviously, we'll need a postId, content, and timestamp for when the post was created. What about other attributes, any ideas?
### Expert 3: How about including an attribute for the number of likes a post has received? This could be useful for displaying the popularity of a post and perhaps sorting them accordingly. Also, we can add a getLikesCount() method similar to the getFollowersCount() method in User class to retrieve the current count of likes at runtime.
### Expert 1: Great suggestions! An attribute for likesCount will provide valuable information about the engagement with each post. Including the getLikesCount() method ensures we always have up-to-date information. Should we also include a method to add comments to a post?
### Expert 2: Definitely, a method for adding comments makes sense. Users should have the ability to interact with each other's posts by leaving comments. And I would also suggest we include a method to delete a post, in case the user decides they no longer want the post to be visible.
### Expert 3: Agreed, the ability to delete a post is important for user control and managing their content on the platform. Okay, now that we've covered the User and Post classes, how about tackling the Follow class?
### Expert 1: Sounds good. So, for the Follow class, we'll need two attributes: followerId and followeeId, both referencing the User class. This will help us establish a relationship between users who follow each other. Question, though: should we have a followStatus attribute to indicate whether the follow is pending, accepted, or rejected?
### Expert 2: That's a good point. Including a followStatus attribute would be helpful in scenarios where a user has requested to follow another user but is still awaiting their response. It'll provide more clarity on the relationship status. Alternatively, instead of an attribute, we could implement a method like getStatus() that checks and returns the current status dynamically. Thoughts?
### Expert 3: I think a getStatus() method would be more refactorable in terms of handling different scenarios like a user deleting or rejecting a follow request. Also, adding the getMessage() method would help users retrieve the related messages with a specific contact even by accessing the Follow instance.
### Expert 1: I agree with having a getStatus() method and adding the getMessage() method to retrieve related messages. The dynamic nature of these methods aligns well with potential changes in follow statuses and can be further expanded on if needed. Alright, I think that covers the Follow class, shall we move on to the final class: Message?
### Expert 2: Perfect. For the Message class, we'll definitely need attributes like senderId and receiverId, which connect to the User class to identify who sent and who received the message. Would a messageContent attribute be sufficient, or should we consider any other attributes?
### Expert 3: In addition to messageContent, we might want to include attributes such as messageTimestamp to indicate when the message was sent or received, as well as a boolean attribute indicating whether the message has been read. This way, we can indicate to users when they have unread messages.
### Expert 1: Good additions. The timestamp attribute will provide valuable information about when messages were sent or received. Including the isRead attribute enables users to easily identify unread messages, improving their overall messaging experience. 
### Expert 2: Agreed. The unread message feature will be helpful in ensuring users stay informed about new messages even if they haven't read them immediately. With that, I believe we have covered all the necessary attributes and methods for the Message class. 
### Expert 3: That's it. We have outlined the basic classes, attributes, and methods required for the social media platform. If any further questions arise or additional specifics about behaviors need to be clarified, we can always seek clarification from the user.  
### Expert 1: Right, solid work team. Now, let's document all of our decisions in our UML class diagram and make sure it accurately represents the desired functionalities of the social media platform.
### Instructions: Step-by-Step Solution:
1. Identify the main entities:
   - User
   - Post
   - Follow
   - Message

2. Create the User class:
   - Define attributes:
     - username: string
     - email: string

     - profilePicture: string
     - bio: string (optional)
   - Define methods:
     - getFollowersCount(): int
     - setName(newName: string)
     - savePost(post: Post)

     - postId: string
     - content: string

   - Notification

7. Establish associations:
   - User class:
     - One-to-many association with Post class (User has multiple posts)
     - One-to-many association with Comment class (User has multiple comments)
     - One-to-many association with Follow class (User can follow multiple users)
     - One-to-many association with Message class (User can send/receive multiple messages)

   - Post class:
     - One-to-many association with Comment class (Post has multiple comments)
