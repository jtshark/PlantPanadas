### Request: Our project is about developing a website where users can create and manage their personal workout plans and track their progress over time.
### Expert 1: So, our user wants a website where they can manage their personal workout plans and track their progress over time. I think we should start by considering the key entities and their relationships. Any thoughts?

### Expert 2: Absolutely. I think the main entities would be User, Workout Plan, and Progress. The User entity would represent the individuals using our platform. The Workout Plan entity would store details about the exercises, sets, and reps that make up a user's plan. And the Progress entity would keep track of the user's progress over time, such as the weight they lifted or the duration of their workouts.

### Expert 3: That sounds good to me. To further refine our class diagram, we should discuss the attributes and methods each entity should have. Let's start with the User entity. Besides the obvious attributes like id, name, and email, what else do you think we should include?

### Expert 1: Firstly, we should include a password attribute for authentication purposes. Additionally, we could store information about the user's age, gender, and current fitness level. Method-wise, we could include functions like changePassword(), updateProfile(), and deleteAccount().

### Expert 2: Those attributes are important for user identity and customization. For the Workout Plan entity, I think it's best to have attributes like planId, title, description, start date, and end date. And for methods, maybe ones like addExercise(), editPlanDetails(), and deletePlan()?

### Expert 3: That sounds reasonable. Now, onto the Progress entity. We should include attributes like progressId, workoutDate, exerciseName, setsCompleted, repsCompleted, and weightUsed. As for methods, we could have addProgress(), updateProgress(), and deleteProgress().

### Expert 1: Agree. One important point to consider is whether we should calculate certain information dynamically rather than storing it as attributes. For example, instead of storing a user's age, we could store their date of birth and calculate the age when needed. It may make the data more accurate.

### Expert 2: That's a good point. It would be more effective to have a getAge() method that calculates the age based on the stored date of birth attribute. This way, we don't have to worry about keeping the age updated in case the user's birthday passes.

### Expert 3: Similarly, when it comes to the Workout Plan entity, instead of storing the total duration of the workout, we can have methods like getDuration() or getEstimatedDuration(). These methods can calculate the duration by summing up the duration of individual exercises.

### Expert 1: Absolutely. It's better to rely on calculations rather than maintaining redundant attributes. This would prevent any inconsistencies and provide accurate results. Oh, and one more thing. Should we include any specific association relationships between these entities?

### Expert 2: I think it would be crucial to have a one-to-many relationship between the User and Workout Plan entities. This way, a user can have multiple workout plans, but each plan will belong to only one user. Are there any other relationships we need to consider?

### Expert 3: Actually, we should establish a one-to-many relationship between the Workout Plan and Progress entities as well. This allows a workout plan to have multiple progress entries associated with it, tracking the user's progress over time.

### Expert 1: That makes sense. So, to summarize, we will have a User entity with attributes like id, name, email, password, age (derived from date of birth), and methods like changePassword() and updateProfile(). The Workout Plan entity will have attributes planId, title, description, start date, and end date, along with methods like addExercise() and editPlanDetails(). Lastly, the Progress entity will have attributes like progressId, workoutDate, exerciseName, setsCompleted, repsCompleted, and weightUsed, with methods such as addProgress() and updateProgress().

### Expert 2: Excellent summary. I think we have a solid understanding of the class diagram structure now. We should proceed to validate these concepts with the user and seek any clarification if needed. 
### Instructions: Here is a step-by-step solution for designing the class diagram:

1. Create a "User" class with attributes: id, name, email, password (encrypted), dateOfBirth.
   - Create methods: changePassword(newPassword: String), updateProfile(profileData: Object), deleteAccount().

2. Create a "Workout Plan" class with attributes: planId, title, description, startDate, endDate.
   - Create methods: addExercise(exerciseData: Object), editPlanDetails(newTitle: String, newDescription: String), deletePlan().

3. Create a "Progress" class with attributes: progressId, workoutDate, exerciseName, setsCompleted, repsCompleted, weightUsed.

4. Establish a one-to-many association between the "User" and "Workout Plan" classes. 
   - The arrow points from the "User" class to the "Workout Plan" class.
   - Multiplicity: 1 "User" owns 0 to many "Workout Plans."

5. Establish a one-to-many association between the "Workout Plan" and "Progress" classes. 
   - The arrow points from the "Workout Plan" class to the "Progress" class.
   - Multiplicity: 1 "Workout Plan" has 0 to many "Progresses."

6. For dynamic information, use methods to calculate derived attributes:
   - "User" class: getAge(): int (calculates age from dateOfBirth attribute).
   - "Workout Plan" class: getDuration(): int (calculates total duration from individual exercise durations).

That completes the development of the class diagram for the website. This diagram illustrates the entities and their relationships, with corresponding attributes and methods. Next, we can proceed with implementing these classes in the website's code.
