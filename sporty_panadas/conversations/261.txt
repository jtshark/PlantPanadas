### Request: Our project involves developing a social media app where users can post photos and videos, follow others, and like/comment on their content.
### Expert 1: So, the user wants us to design a UML class diagram for a social media app. Any initial thoughts on how we can approach this?

### Expert 2: Well, we can start by identifying the main entities involved in this app: users, content (photos and videos), and interactions (follow, like, and comment). We can then think about the attributes and behaviors that each entity should have.

### Expert 3: That's a good starting point. Let's begin with the user entity. It should typically have attributes like a unique username, full name, email, and password for authentication purposes. And for behaviors, it should have methods such as login and logout. Any additional attributes or methods that we should consider for this entity?

### Expert 2: I think we could add a profile picture attribute as well. It could be an image file that represents the user visually. Also, we might want to think about how to handle friends or followers for the user. Would it make sense to add a list of followers/following as an attribute?

### Expert 1: That definitely makes sense. By storing a list of followers/following as an attribute, we can easily retrieve and display that information on the user's profile. We could also consider adding methods like addFollower and removeFollower to allow users to manage their followers easily.

### Expert 3: Agreed. Moving on to the content entity, we already mentioned photos and videos. I think we should include attributes like the file name, file size, and the date and time of upload. We could also add properties like number of likes and comments. Any other attributes and methods we should consider?

### Expert 2: One useful attribute could be the geolocation of where the photo or video was taken. This could enable users to search for content by location. Additionally, we could consider adding methods to increase the number of likes and comments and ones to retrieve that information.

### Expert 1: That's a good point. Another consideration could be handling hashtags or tags related to the content. Users might want to search for specific themes or topics, so we can have attributes for tags and methods to add and remove them from a post. Should we move on to the interactions entity next?

### Expert 3: Definitely. Interactions include things like following other users, liking posts, and commenting on them. We can add methods for each of those behaviors. We might also want to consider how to handle comments. Would it be appropriate to have a Comment class?

### Expert 2: I think it would be a good idea to have a separate Comment class. It could have attributes like the comment text, the user who posted it, and the date and time of the comment. Additionally, we could consider adding a method for deleting a comment. By having this separate class, we can optimize querying and managing the comments individually.

### Expert 1: Agreed. This added complexity ensures that comments are handled efficiently and that we have flexibility in managing them. 

### Expert 3: So, to summarize our plan, we'll have User as the main entity with attributes like username, full name, email, password, profile picture, list of followers/following, and a method for login/logout. Then we'll have Content with attributes like file name, file size, upload date, geolocation, number of likes/comments, tags, and methods to retrieve and modify that information. And finally, the Interactions class that can handle follow, like, and comments through specific methods.

### Expert 2: That sounds like a good base for our UML class diagram. Of course, we might need clarification from the user on some aspects if we encounter any uncertainties or ambiguities along the way.

### Expert 1: Definitely. We should start implementing this diagram and request clarification whenever needed to ensure we capture the user's requirements accurately.

### Expert 3: Agreed. Let's proceed with the diagram and make sure we cover all the necessary information.
### Instructions: 1. Create a class called "User" with the following attributes: username (String), fullName (String), email (String), password (String), profilePicture (Image), followers (List<User>), following (List<User>).

2. Add behaviors to the "User" class: login(), logout(), addFollower(User user), and removeFollower(User user).

3. Create a class called "Content" with the following attributes: fileName (String), fileSize (int), uploadDate (DateTime), geoLocation (String), likes (int), comments (List<Comment>), and tags (List<String>).

4. Add behaviors to the "Content" class: incrementLikes(), incrementComments(Comment comment), decrementComments(Comment comment), addTag(String tag), and removeTag(String tag).

5. Create a class called "Comment" with the following attributes: text (String), user (User), and creationDate (DateTime).

6. Create associations between the classes:
- User has multiple Content objects (1-to-many association for posts made by the user).
- Content has a User creator (1-to-1 association for the user who posted the content).
- Content has multiple Comment objects (1-to-many association for comments on the content).
- Comment has a User creator (1-to-1 association for the user who posted the comment).

7. Update the User class to include a list of Content objects (posts) made by the user. Use a 1-to-many association.

8. Update the Comment class to include a Content object associated with the comment. Use a 1-to-1 association.

9. Lastly, update the User class to include methods such as getPosts(), addPost(Content content), deletePost(Content content).
