### Request: Our project is a website where users can sign up, post job listings, apply for jobs, and communicate with potential employers.
### Expert 1: Alright, so let's start by identifying the major entities in our system. Obviously, we have a User entity that will store information about all the users in our website.

### Expert 2: Agreed. And then we'll need a Job entity to represent the job listings on our website.

### Expert 3: And don't forget about Employer entity to represent the companies or individuals who are posting the job listings.

### Expert 1: You're right, thanks for mentioning that. Now, let's dig deeper into the attributes of each entity. For the User entity, we might have attributes like name, email, password, and maybe a picture or avatar. Also, should we store the user's date of birth?

### Expert 2: I think storing the date of birth would be a good idea. That way, we can later calculate and display the user's age. Plus, there might be some age restrictions for certain job listings.

### Expert 3: I agree with that reasoning. It also allows us to gather demographic information for analysis or personalized features. Now, let's move on to the Job entity. What attributes do you think we should include?

### Expert 1: Well, we need attributes such as title, description, location, and maybe even a salary range. Additionally, should we add an attribute for the application deadline?

### Expert 2: Absolutely. Including the application deadline will allow us to keep track of when job seekers need to submit their applications.

### Expert 3: Great idea. Now let's consider the Employer entity. In addition to the company or individual's name, should we include any attributes for contact information?

### Expert 1: Yes, I think we should include attributes for the email and maybe even a phone number, if the employers choose to provide one.

### Expert 2: What about documenting the interactions between users and employers? Should we include that in our Class Diagram?

### Expert 3: I think we can model that as a separate entity called Interaction. It could have attributes like message, timestamp, and a foreign key referencing the user who sent it.

### Expert 1: Agreed. And we can have a relationship between the User and Interaction entities to represent that the user can have many interactions.

### Expert 2: This sounds good. Anything else that we should consider?

### Expert 3: We might also think about including relationships between Job and Employer entities. For example, the Job entity might have an Employer foreign key to specify which employer posted it.

### Expert 1: That makes sense. It will allow us to easily retrieve the employer information associated with each job listing.

### Expert 2: Alright, so to summarize, we have identified the major entities as User, Job, Employer, and Interaction. We've discussed some attributes for each entity and decided to include some specific relationships. Is there anything else we need to address?

### Expert 1: I believe that covers the initial design. Of course, as we delve deeper into the functionalities and gather more requirements from the user, we may need to revise or extend the class diagram. But for now, I think we have a good foundation to start working on.

### Expert 2: Agreed. It's always a good idea to involve the user in the design process and seek clarification whenever there is ambiguity. This way, we can ensure that our class diagram aligns with the desired functionality.

### Expert 3: Absolutely. Now, let's document everything we discussed and start working on the implementation of our website. Anything else we should consider before wrapping up?

### Expert 1: One last thing, we should create a brief summary of our design decisions and include them to be shared with the development team so everyone is on the same page.

### Expert 2: Good call. That will help ensure a smooth transition from design to implementation. Okay then, let's get to work!
### Instructions: Solution:

1. Create a User class with the following attributes: 
   - name : String
   - email : String
   - password : String
   - dateOfBirth : Date

2. Create a Job class with the following attributes:
   - title : String
   - description : String
   - location : String
   - salaryRange : String
   - applicationDeadline : Date

3. Create an Employer class with the following attributes:
   - name : String
   - email : String
   - phoneNumber : String (optional)

4. Create an Interaction class with the following attributes:
   - message : String
   - timestamp : Date

5. Create a one-to-many relationship between the User and Interaction classes, where a User can have multiple Interactions.

6. Create a one-to-many relationship between the Job and Employer classes, where an Employer can post multiple Jobs.

7. Add a foreign key attribute to the Job class, referencing the Employer who posted it.

8. Review and make any necessary modifications or additions to the class diagram based on further user requirements or functionality.

Your class diagram should now accurately represent the initial design requirements of the website.
