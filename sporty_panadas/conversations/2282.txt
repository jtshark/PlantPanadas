### Request: Develop an app for a healthcare organization which helps patients to book appointments with doctors according to their availability, maintain medical history, and be able to view drug prescriptions.
### Expert 1: So, we're designing an app for a healthcare organization that will allow patients to book appointments with doctors based on their availability. It should also maintain the patients' medical history and allow them to view drug prescriptions. 

### Expert 2: Great, let's start by identifying the main entities in our system. We need Patient, Doctor, Appointment, Medical History, and Drug Prescription. 

### Expert 3: Right, and we can start by creating a UML class diagram to represent these entities. We should also think about the attributes and methods for each class. The Patient class, for example, may have attributes like name, address, and phone number. 

### Expert 1: We should also include attributes like date of birth and gender for better patient identification and analysis. And for convenience, it might be a good idea to have a method in the Patient class to calculate the age based on the date of birth.

### Expert 2: That's a good suggestion. Additionally, the Doctor class should have attributes such as name, specialization, and availability. For the availability attribute, we could use a nested class or a data structure to store the doctor's working hours.

### Expert 3: Yes, and we should also have a method in the Doctor class to check if the doctor is available during a specific time slot. That way, we can easily check for open slots when a patient wants to schedule an appointment.

### Expert 1: Agreed. Now, for the Appointment class, we can include attributes like appointment date and time, patient, and doctor. And we should have methods to create and cancel appointments.

### Expert 2: Good point. As for the Medical History class, we'll need to store details like diagnosis, treatment provided, and any relevant notes. This class should also have a method for updating the medical history.

### Expert 3: And for the Drug Prescription class, we can have attributes like the prescribed drug name, dosage, and duration. We might need a method here to validate the prescription details against any possible allergies or known interactions with other drugs in the patient's medical history.

### Expert 1: That's an important consideration. So, our UML class diagram will have associations between the Patient, Doctor, and Appointment classes. The Medical History and Drug Pre
### Instructions: Below is a step-by-step solution for designing the class diagram:

Step 1: Create the Patient class with the following attributes:
- Name: String
- Address: String
- Phone Number: String
- Date of Birth: Date
- Gender: String

Step 2: Create a method in the Patient class to calculate the age based on the date of birth.

Step 3: Create the Doctor class with the following attributes:
- Name: String
- Specialization: String
- Availability: list[(Start Time: Time, End Time: Time)]

Step 4: Create a method in the Doctor class to check if the doctor is available during a specific time slot.

Step 5: Create the Appointment class with the following attributes:
- Appointment Date and Time: DateTime
- Patient: Patient
- Doctor: Doctor

Step 6: Create methods in the Appointment class to create and cancel appointments.

Step 7: Create the Medical History class with the following attributes:
- Diagnosis: String
- Treatment Provided: String
- Notes: String

Step 8: Create a method in the Medical History class to update the medical history.

Step 9: Create the Drug Prescription class with the following attributes:
- Medication Name: String
- Dosage: String
- Duration: String

Step 10: Create associations between the classes:
- Patient has multiple Appointments
- Doctor has multiple Appointments
- Patient has a single Medical History
- Patient has multiple Drug Prescriptions.

That's it! With these steps, you'll have designed a class diagram for the app that helps patients book appointments, maintain medical history, and view drug prescriptions.
