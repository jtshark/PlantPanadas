### Request: Our project is to develop a mobile app that will allow users to track their daily water intake, set goals, and receive reminders to stay hydrated.
### Expert 1: So, based on the user's request, we need to design a UML class diagram for this mobile app. In my opinion, we should have a User class that will store the user's information like name, age, weight, and gender. We can also have a method in this class to calculate the daily water intake goal based on weight.

### Expert 2: I agree with having a User class. Additionally, we should have a WaterIntake class to track the water intake of each user. This class can have attributes like date, time, and amount of water consumed. We can also have methods to add water intake, get total daily intake, and check if the user has achieved their goal for the day.

### Expert 3: That sounds good. We also need a Goal class to allow users to set their daily water intake goals. It can have attributes like goalDate and goalAmount. This class should have methods to set and update the goal. We can associate this class with the User class.

### Expert 1: I think we should also consider having a Reminder class to send reminders for users to stay hydrated. This class can have attributes like reminderDate, reminderTime, and message. We can associate this class with the User class as well.

### Expert 2: That's a great addition. Another class we might need is a Notification class to manage the notifications sent to users. It can handle sending reminders and messages to the users. We can associate this class with the Reminder class and have methods to add, delete, and update notifications.

### Expert 3: I agree. And since we are developing a mobile app, we should include a MobileApp class as the main class. This class can handle the user interface, interaction with other classes, and initiate the app functionalities.

### Expert 1: Right, the MobileApp class should have methods to handle user registration, login, and providing a dashboard displaying the user's water intake, goal progress, and reminders.

### Expert 2: I think we have covered most of the requirements. Let's review the associations to make sure we have them right. The User class has a one-to-many association with the WaterIntake and Goal classes. It also has a composition relationship with the Reminder class since a user can have multiple reminders.

### Expert 3: Agreed. Additionally, the Reminder class is associated with the Notification class, which has an aggregation relationship with the MobileApp class.

### Expert 1: Good summary. I believe this UML class diagram covers the main functionalities requested by the user. However, I have a question regarding the goal amount in the Goal class. Should it be a fixed value set by the user, or should it depend on the user's weight like the daily intake calculation?


### Instructions: Step-by-step solution:

1. Create a User class with attributes like `name`, `age`, `weight`, `gender`.
2. Add a method to the User class to calculate the daily water intake goal based on weight.
3. Create a WaterIntake class with attributes like `date`, `time`, and `amount` to track daily water intake.
4. Add methods to the WaterIntake class to add water intake, get total daily intake, and check if the user has achieved their goal for the day.
5. Create a Goal class with attributes like `goalDate` and `goalAmount` to allow users to set their daily water intake goals.
6. Add methods to the Goal class to set and update the goal.
7. Add an association between the User and Goal classes (one-to-one or one-to-many, depending on the requirements).
8. Create a Reminder class with attributes like `reminderDate`, `reminderTime`, and `message` to send reminders to users.
9. Add an association between the User and Reminder classes (one-to-many).
10. Create a Notification class to manage notifications sent to users.
11. Add attributes to the Notification class to store information about notifications.
12. Add an aggregation relationship between the Reminder and Notification classes (Reminder aggregates Notification).
13. Create a MobileApp class as the main class for the app.
14. Implement methods in the MobileApp class for user registration, login, and providing a dashboard with the user's water intake, goal progress, and reminders.
15. Add an association between the Notification and MobileApp classes (one-to-many or many-to-many, depending on notification handling requirements).
16. Implement the necessary functionality to create, modify, and delete instances of each class as required by the app's operations.
