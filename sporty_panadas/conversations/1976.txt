### Request: I need a visual diagram that outlines the different type of users, what they can do on my website, and how they interact with each other. This will include all the features I want my website to have.
### Expert 1: I think we should start by identifying the different types of users that will be using the website. Any thoughts on that?

### Expert 2: Absolutely. We could have various user roles such as administrators, registered users, and guests. The administrators would have complete access to all the features and functionalities, while registered users would have limited access and guests would have even less access.

### Expert 3: That sounds about right. So, let's begin by sketching out these different user roles and their respective privileges on our UML class diagram. We can denote them as separate classes with the associated attributes and methods. 

### Expert 1: Good point. But do we know what specific actions or features each of these user roles would have access to?

### Expert 2: This is where we might need some clarification from the user. We should reach out to them to get a detailed understanding of the features they want on the website for each user role. 

### Expert 3: Agreed. Let's clarify with the user. It's important to understand their requirements and avoid making assumptions. 

### QUESTION: Could you please provide us with the list of features or actions that you want each user role to have on your website? 
### Answer: 
For my administrator users, I would like them to have access to functionality such as managing accounts, moderators, and products on the website. I would also like them to be able to access reports, analytics, and settings for the website as well as view the activity logs from all users of the website. 

For registered users, I would like them to be able to view or purchase products, post or delete money transactions as well as leave comments about any related products. 

Finally, for guests, I would like them to be able to view the various products available on the website, proceed checkout for purchases, and also view any pricing discounts available.
### Expert 1: Got it. We have a clear understanding of the features each user role should have now. Let's start by adding the administrator class to our UML class diagram. We can add attributes like 'username' and 'password' for account management. And we can also include methods like 'manageModerators()' and 'manageProducts()' for respective functionalities. 

### Expert 2: Right. And for the registered user class, we can include attributes like 'username' and 'email' for identification purposes. We should also add methods like 'viewProduct()' and 'purchaseProduct()', as well as 'postComment()' and 'deleteComment()' for interactions related to products and money transactions.

### Expert 3: Yes, and for the guest class, we should include attributes for flight information such as 'productList' to store available products,'checkOut()' method for proceeding with purchase,and 'viewDiscounts()' method for viewing price discounts.

### Expert 1: Agreed. We should also consider having a base class "User" that contains common attributes like 'username' and 'email' that are inherited by the administrator and registered user classes.

### Expert 2: That's a great suggestion. By having a user class, we can avoid duplicating attributes in multiple classes.

### Expert 3: Absolutely. This base class will make our class diagram more organized and ensure better consistency.

### Expert 1: So, we can include the attributes and methods we discussed for each type of user in our class diagram. This will give a visual representation of their interactions and the features they have access to on the website.

### Expert 3: Perfect! Let's proceed with sketching out the class diagram, incorporating everything we have discussed. This will not only provide clarity for us but will also help the user visualize the desired functionality.

### Expert 2: Indeed. And don't forget, if any further clarifications arise, we can always come back with more questions for the user.

### Expert 3: Absolutely. We should have a well-defined class diagram that aligns with the user's requirements.

### Instructions: Step-by-step solution for the design of the class diagram:

1. Start by creating a "User" class as the base class
   - Add attributes: 'username' (String), 'email' (String)
  
2.  Create an "Administrator" subclass that extends the "User" class
   - Add attributes: 'password' (String)
   - Add methods: 'manageAccounts()', 'manageModerators()', 'manageProducts()', 'accessReports()', 'accessAnalytics()', 'accessSettings()', 'viewActivityLogs()'

3. Create a "RegisteredUser" subclass that extends the "User" class
   - Add methods: 'viewProduct()', 'purchaseProduct()', 'postComment()', 'deleteComment()'
   - Consider adding attributes for additional functionalities like 'postTransactions()' 

4. Create a "Guest" class 
   - Add attributes for flight information: 'productList' (List), 'fareClass' (String)
   - Methods: 'viewProduct()', 'proceedCheckOut()', 'viewDiscounts()'

5. Add relationships between the classes
   - Add an association between the "User" class (base class) and "Administrator", "RegisteredUser", and "Guest" subclasses.
   - Ensure the correct multiplicity and navigability for the associations

6. Optional: Consider adding additional classes or refining the existing ones based on further requirements or constraints.

7. Review the class diagram for completeness, accuracy, and clarity and ensure it aligns with the user's requested features.

8. Update and modify the class diagram as needed based on further discussions or changes in requirements.

9. Export or present the final class diagram to stakeholders for their review and approval before proceeding to the website development phase.

(Note: The experts may decide to use specialized UML tools/software to create the class diagram more efficiently.)
