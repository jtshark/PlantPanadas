### Request: Our project is a mobile application that allows users to create a to-do list and set reminders for their daily tasks.
### Expert 1: So, our user wants a mobile application that helps them manage their to-do tasks and set reminders. To start designing the UML class diagram, let's think about the main components we need to include. 
### Expert 2: Absolutely. I think we should have a class for tasks, users, and reminders. Each task will be associated with a user, and reminders will be set for specific tasks. 
### Expert 3: I agree with that. We could also consider having a separate class for categories, so that users can organize their tasks into different categories like work, personal, or shopping.
### Instructions: Step 1: Create a User class
- Add attributes like username, password, and email.
- Add methods for creating, modifying, and authenticating a user.

Step 2: Create a Task class
- Add attributes like taskName, description, dueDate, and category.
- Add methods for creating, modifying, and deleting a task.

Step 3: Create a Category class
- Add attribute categoryName.
- Add methods for creating, modifying, and deleting a category.

Step 4: Create a Reminder class
- Add attributes like reminderTime and reminderMessage.
- Add methods for setting, modifying, and canceling a reminder.

Step 5: Define associations between classes
- User has a one-to-many association with Task (one user can have multiple tasks).
- Task has a many-to-one association with Category (multiple tasks can be in the same category).
- Task has a many-to-many association with Reminder (multiple tasks can have multiple reminders).

Step 6: Add additional methods for the application
- Implement a method in User class to add tasks to their to-do list.
- Implement a method in Task class to add reminders to a specific task.
- Implement a method in Task class to mark a task as completed or incomplete.
- Implement a method in Task class to view all the reminders associated with a task or a user's upcoming reminders.

Step 7: Optional enhancements
- Implement a search feature to allow users to find tasks based on keywords or category.
- Implement a sorting feature to sort tasks by due date, category, or completion status.
- Implement a sharing feature to share tasks with other application users.

Note: This solution is a basic outline for the design of the class diagram. Depending on the requirements and scope of the project, additional attributes and methods can be added or modified.
