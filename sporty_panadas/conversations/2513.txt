### Request: My project involves building a social media platform where users can connect with each other, share photos and videos, and receive real-time notifications. The platform should have a user profile, ability to search and follow other users, and a newsfeed that displays the latest activity from other users.
### Expert 1: So, we have a user who's requesting a UML class diagram for a social media platform. Let's start by identifying the main components that need to be represented in this diagram.

### Expert 2: Absolutely. Based on the user's request, it seems like we need to have a user profile with basic information, a feature to search and follow other users, and a newsfeed to display updated activity. I think we should also consider features for photo and video sharing since they mentioned it.

### Expert 3: Agreed. A user profile would typically include user-specific information such as their username, email, date of birth, and maybe even a profile picture. We can also include methods to update the profile or retrieve user details. For the search and follow functionality, we'll need a way to store the list of users which the customer is following. And for the newsfeed, it can aggregate posts and updates from the followed users.

### Expert 1: Makes sense. We also need to represent the functionality for sharing photos and videos. Should we consider having separate classes for photos and videos?

### Expert 2: In my experience, it would be more practical to include photos and videos as attributes of a generic "Post" class rather than creating separate classes for them. This way, a user can create a post with either a photo or video, or both.

### Expert 3: Great suggestion, call the Post class having attributes like content, timestamp, and maybe even geolocation if it's available. It should also have methods to share the post and get the details. Additionally, we can consider including hashtags and mentions as attributes within the Post class.

### Expert 1: Good point. By including hashtags and mentions within the Post class, we can make it easier for users to search for posts using specific keywords or to mention other users in their content. Do we need any additional classes to represent notifications or followers?

### Expert 2: Definitely. We'll need to include a separate class for notifications, capturing information like the type of notification (such as a comment, like, or follow), timestamp, and the users it's related to. We can then have methods to mark notifications as read or unread, and retrieve the details.

### Expert 3: Good call. Additionally, we can include a separate class to represent the relationship between users, call it "UserConnection." This class will store details about users following each other or being mutual connections. It can have attributes such as the follower, the one being followed, and their connection status (like "mutual" or "follower"). Plus, methods to establish connections, search for connections, and manage connection statuses.

### Expert 1: I agree. Representing connections as a separate class simplifies the design of the system. Now, what about the search functionality? Should we include a separate class for search or should it be a method within the User class?

### Expert 2: Including search functionality as a method within the User class would make more sense. We can then define different search criteria, such as searching by username, name, location, or even hashtags. This way, it can be a flexible method that allows users to conduct various searches based on their needs.

### Expert 3: Along with that, we can also consider including a recommendation system where the search method suggests relevant profiles to the user based on their interests or connections. Additionally, we should code some functionality like "explore" on the homepage. By default, it could show popular or trending posts from across the platform.

### Expert 1: Exactly. Including a recommendation system and an "explore" feature would enhance the overall user experience. Alright, I think we have covered most of the main functionalities. Let's summarize the classes we've discussed so far.

Summary:
- User (attributes: username, email, date of birth, profile picture; methods: updateProfile(), getUserDetails())
- Post (attributes: content, hashtags, mentions, timestamp, geolocation; methods: sharePost(), getPostDetails())
- Connection (attributes: follower, followed, status; methods: establishConnection(), searchConnections())
- Notification (attributes: type, timestamp, users related; methods: markAsRead(), getNotificationDetails())
- Search (methods within the User class: searchByCriteria())

### Expert 2: Looks great! I think we've covered all the necessary functionalities requested by the user. The next step would be to identify the relationships and associations between these classes, but let's pause for a moment. I have a question regarding searching the newsfeed. How detailed should the post filtering be? Should users be able to search by specific filters like location, hashtags, or usernames?

### Expert 1: That's a good question. We'll need to clarify from the user. Also, we can suggest some common filters based on our experience, like filtering by hashtags and usernames. We'll just need some concrete guidance on what the user specifically wants in terms of search capabilities.

### Expert 3: Agreed. Once we have that information, we can refine the UML class diagram accordingly.
### Instructions: Solution:

1. Create a class called "User" with attributes:
   - username: string
   - email: string
   - dateOfBirth: date
   - profilePicture: image

2. Add methods to the "User" class:
   - updateProfile(): void
   - getUserDetails(): UserDetails

3. Create a class called "Post" with attributes:
   - content: string
   - hashtags: string[]
   - mentions: string[]
   - timestamp: datetime
   - geolocation: string

4. Add methods to the "Post" class:
   - sharePost(): void
   - getPostDetails(): PostDetails

5. Create a class called "UserConnection" with attributes:
   - follower: User
   - followed: User
   - status: string

6. Add methods to the "UserConnection" class:
   - establishConnection(): void
   - searchConnections(): User[]

7. Create a class called "Notification" with attributes:
   - type: string
   - timestamp: datetime
   - usersRelated: User[]

8. Add methods to the "Notification" class:
   - markAsRead(): void
   - getNotificationDetails(): NotificationDetails

9. Add a method called "searchByCriteria(criteria: string)" to the "User" class for searching users based on criteria like username, name, location, or hashtags.

10. Add a class called "Search" representing the search functionality for the social media platform. This class should have a method called "recommendProfiles(user: User): User[]" that suggests relevant profiles to the user based on their interests or connections.

11. OPTIONAL: Add a method called "exploreHomepage(): Post[]" to the "User" class. By default, this method can display popular or trending posts from across the platform on the user's homepage.

12. Define associations between classes:
    - User: 1-to-many association with UserConnection (as a follower or followed user)
    - User: many-to-many association with Post (created posts)
    - User: many-to-many association with Notification (related notifications)
    - User: 1-to-many association with Search (participates in search functionality)
    - Search: 1-to-1 association with User (personalized search for each user)

Now the UML class diagram should include the classes User, Post, UserConnection, Notification, and Search, with their respective attributes and methods, along with the defined associations.
