### Request: We need to create a diagram depicting all the different screens and features of our mobile app, indicating how users can navigate through it and what actions they can perform.
### Expert 1: So, we are tasked with creating a visual representation of all the screens and features of our mobile app? 
### Expert 2: That's right. We need to show how users can navigate through the app and what actions they can perform on each screen. 
### Expert 3: Before we dive into designing a class diagram for that, can we clarify a few things with the user? 
### Expert 1: Absolutely. We want to make sure we have a clear understanding of their requirements. 
### QUESTION: Could you please provide more details on the type of actions users can perform in the app? 
### Answer:  Users can log-in, view a list of items, make a purchase, and view a list of orders. They can also update their profile information.
### Expert 2: I have an idea. What if we create a class called "User" to represent the user's profile information. This class can have attributes such as name, email, and password. 
### Expert 3: That sounds good. And we can add methods to this User class to enable actions like log-in and update profile information. 
### Expert 1: Agreed. Now, for the list of items, we can have another class called "Item" which will have attributes like name, description, and price. 
### Expert 2: Should we consider adding a method for retrieving discounted prices of items? 
### Expert 1: That's a good point. It would be more flexible to store the price and define a method to calculate and return the discounted price, based on any relevant discounts. One can easily update discounts or apply different ones in the future. 
### Expert 3: Absolutely. That way, any updates in discount percentages will automatically reflect in calculations, without having to change the data stored for each item. 
### Expert 2: Moving on, let's design a class called "Order", which would represent a user's order. This class can have attributes like order number, date, and total price. 
### Expert 1: To further enhance the flexibility, instead of storing the total price directly, we can have another class called "Price" with attributes like basePrice and discount. This will allow us to easily calculate the discounted price based on the base price and discount percentage. 
### Expert 3: Good thinking. Additionally, we can have associations between classes. For example, a User can have multiple Orders, and an Order can be associated with multiple Items. 
### Expert 2: That makes sense. Let's also include a navigation class or system to indicate how users can move through the app. We can add methods in our class diagram to outline the different screens the user can navigate to. 
### Expert 1: Agreed. It is important to provide a clear navigation path through the app, indicating which actions or interactions can lead to specific screens. 
### Expert 3: Absolutely. By considering all these factors, we will have a comprehensive and easily comprehensible visual representation of the different screens and features of our mobile app.
### Instructions: Step 1: Create a "User" class with attributes like name, email, and password.
Step 2: Define methods in the "User" class for actions such as log-in and updating profile information.
Step 3: Create an "Item" class with attributes like name, description, and basePrice.
Step 4: Define a method in the "Item" class to calculate the discounted price based on the base price and discount.
Step 5: Create an "Order" class with attributes like order number, date, and totalPrice.
Step 6: Define associations between classes. A User can have multiple Orders and an Order can be associated with multiple Items.
Step 7: Create a "Price" class with attributes like basePrice and discount.
Step 8: Modify the "Order" class to have an attribute totalPrice of type "Price" instead of directly storing the total price.
Step 9: Define methods in the "User" class to allow viewing a list of items and placing a purchase order.
Step 10: Define a method in the "User" class to view a list of orders.
Step 11: Specify the navigation system or class to illustrate how users can move through the app and indicate the different screens they can navigate to.
