### Request: A social media application where users can share photos and videos, follow other users, and engage in comments and likes on posts.
### Expert 1: So, we have a user request to design a UML class diagram for a social media application. The basic features seem to be sharing photos and videos, following other users, and either commenting or liking posts. Does that absorb everything so far?

### Expert 2: Yes, that covers the main functionalities. I'm thinking we should start with a "User" class, as it will hold basic information like username, password, email, and profile picture. 

### Expert 3: Agreed. We should also include attributes like "followers" and "following" as associations with other User objects.

### Expert 1: Right. And speaking of posts, it seems like our User might need to create them too, so it feels appropriate to include a "Post" class.

### Expert 2: Yes. The Post class can have attributes like "createdAt", "caption", "location", and maybe even a reference to the User who posted it. And we'll need a way for Users to interact with the posts.

### Expert 3: Absolutely. We should consider including a "Like" class and a "Comment" class. These can both have associations with the "User" and "Post" classes.

### Expert 1: Good point. Should we add some navigability to specify which User like a given post or made a particular comment?

### Expert 3: Yes, to make this clearer, let's add two navigational properties. One in "Like" representing the User who liked a post and one in "Comment" pointing to the User who made the comment.

### Expert 2: And I assume we'll want to show that a User can like multiple posts and leave multiple comments, right?

### Expert 3: Exactly. We can represent these associations using multiplicity. So, a User can have a "likedPosts" attribute and a "comments" attribute, both represented as a collection of Posts and Comments respectively.

### Expert 1: Agreed. This setup will make it easy to retrieve all the posts liked by a User or all the comments made by them.

### Expert 2: For displaying the posts in the user's feed, shall we include a "Following" class to track the User's followed accounts?

### Expert 3: Great idea. The "Following" class can have a reference to the follower User and another one to the account being followed.

### Expert 1: Should we add any additional methods or attributes to these classes that could improve the functionality?

### Expert 2: How about adding a method in the User class called "getFeed" that retrieves all the relevant posts from the accounts the user follows? This way, the feed could always be up to date.

### Expert 3: In addition, we could include a method in the Post class called "getLikesCount" that returns the number of likes the post has received. Having it as a method instead of an attribute saves us from constantly updating the count when new likes come in.

### Expert 1: Good call. It's often better to calculate dynamic values like that to avoid redundancy and ensure accuracy.

### Expert 2: I agree. And regarding the User class, should we include a method to get the age based on their date of birth instead of directly saving the age as an attribute?

### Expert 3: Yes, that's a good approach. It's more logical to store the date of birth as an attribute in the User class and have a "getAge" method calculated based on the current date.

### Expert 1: One last thing, should we consider incorporating an additional class for storing and managing continuity within comments, like a "Reply" class?

### Expert 2: Hmm, it depends on the requirements. If we need the ability to have threaded comments, then having a "Reply" class as a separate entity to represent replies could be beneficial.

### Expert 3: Agreed. That gives more flexibility in handling comment hierarchies, especially in cases where nested replies might have their own likes and comments.

### Expert 1: Alright then, I think we've covered all the necessary aspects for the social media application. Shall we start sketching the UML class diagram based on our discussion?

### Expert 2: Absolutely. It's a good plan to get it visualized, review it, and iterate if needed.

### Expert 3: Let's get to it. I'm excited to see our design take shape based on these expert considerations and envision how all the user requirements can be fulfilled in an elegant way.
### Instructions: 1. Create a class named "User" with the following attributes:
   - username: String
   - password: String
   - email: String
   - profilePicture: Image

2. Add the following associations to the "User" class:
   - followers: User[] (Many-to-many association)
   - following: User[] (Many-to-many association)
   - likedPosts: Post[] (Many-to-many association)
   - comments: Comment[] (Many-to-many association)

3. Create a class named "Post" with the following attributes:
   - createdAt: Date
   - caption: String
   - location: String

4. Add the following associations to the "Post" class:
   - postedBy: User (One-to-one association)
   - likes: Like[] (One-to-many association)
   - comments: Comment[] (One-to-many association)

5. Create a class named "Like" with no attributes.

6. Add the following associations to the "Like" class:
   - likedBy: User (Many-to-one association)
   - post: Post (Many-to-one association)

7. Create a class named "Comment" with the following attributes:
   - text: String
   - createdAt: Date

8. Add the following associations to the "Comment" class:
   - commentedBy: User (Many-to-one association)
   - post: Post (Many-to-one association)
   - repliedTo: Comment (One-to-many association)

9. Create a class named "Following" with no attributes.

10. Add the following associations to the "Following" class:
    - follower: User (Many-to-one association)
    - account: User (Many-to-one association)

11. Add the following methods to the "User" class:
    - getFeed(): Post[] (returns the posts from followed accounts)
    - getAge(): Integer (calculates the age based on the date of birth)

12. Add the following methods to the "Post" class:
    - getLikesCount(): Integer (returns the number of likes on the post)

13. Please note that the solution suggests to add a "Reply" class whenever threaded comments are needed /required based on more specific requirements that are not published in this conversation.However, for the basic requirements stated in the discussion, the current design does not include the "Reply" class.

That concludes the steps to create the UML class diagram for the social media application.
