### Request: Our project aims to develop a mobile application that allows users to book appointments, track their medical history, find doctors in their area, and receive push notifications for upcoming appointments.
### Expert 1: So, we need to design a UML class diagram for this mobile application. We have a few key functionalities: booking appointments, tracking medical history, and finding doctors. We also need to incorporate push notifications for upcoming appointments. Any initial thoughts on the design?

### Expert 2: Yeah, I think we should start by identifying the main entities in this system. We obviously need a User class to represent the application users. We also need a Doctor class to store information about the doctors. And we'll need an Appointment class to handle the booking of appointments. What do you guys think?

### Expert 3: I agree with the User and Doctor classes, but I think we can break down the Appointment class further. Instead of having just one Appointment class, I think we should have separate classes for UserAppointments and DoctorAppointments. This would allow us to store specific information related to the appointments, such as appointment time, doctor's availability, and appointment status.

### Expert 1: That makes sense. By having separate classes for UserAppointments and DoctorAppointments, we can also ensure that each class focuses on its own responsibilities. Additionally, it will be easier to track and manage appointments for each party.

### Expert 2: To track the medical history of the users, we can add a MedicalHistory class that has a one-to-many association with the User class. This way, a user can have multiple medical records associated with them.

### Expert 3: Absolutely. Storing medical history as a separate class ensures better organization and separation of concerns. It also allows us to easily retrieve and update medical records for a particular user.

### Expert 1: I'm also thinking about how to implement the push notification functionality. One approach could be to have another class called Notification that has an association with the User class. This class would handle sending push notifications for upcoming appointments. We could have various attributes like notification message and delivery date.

### Expert 2: That's a good idea. By encapsulating the push notification functionality in its own class, we can ensure better maintainability and reusability. We'll just need to define the necessary methods for sending and managing notifications.

### Expert 3: I agree. This way, we can also add additional notification capabilities in the future without having to modify the User or Appointment classes.

### Expert 1: One last thing to consider is how to find doctors in a user's area. One approach would be to have a separate class called DoctorFinder that takes in location as a parameter and then returns a list of doctors in that area. This class could have various methods for searching doctors based on different criteria like specialization or distance.

### Expert 2: That sounds good. By having a separate class for finding doctors, we can keep the Doctor class focused on storing doctor information and encapsulate the searching logic in the DoctorFinder class.

### Expert 3: Agreed. It's important to have a separation of concerns to keep the design modular and maintainable.

### Expert 1: So, to summarize, we have User, Doctor, UserAppointments, and DoctorAppointments as our main classes. We also have classes for MedicalHistory, Notification, and DoctorFinder. Is that everything we need for now?

### Expert 2: It looks good to me. We can always iterate and add more classes or refine the design as necessary.

### Expert 3: I think we have covered the major functionalities and entities needed for the mobile application. We should be ready to move forward with this initial design.
### Instructions: 1. Create a User class with attributes such as userID, username, password, email, and contactNumber.

2. Create a Doctor class with attributes like doctorID, doctorName, specialization, and contactNumber.

3. Create a UserAppointment class with attributes appointmentID, appointmentDateTime, appointmentStatus, and a reference to the corresponding User and Doctor entities to represent the booking an appointment made by the user.

4. Create a DoctorAppointment class with attributes like appointmentID, appointmentDateTime, appointmentStatus, and a reference to the corresponding User and Doctor entities to represent the appointment scheduled by a doctor.

5. Create a MedicalHistory class with attributes medicalRecordID, disease, prescription, and a reference to the corresponding User to handle the tracking of a user's medical history.

6. Create a Notification class with attributes notificationID, message, deliveryDate, and a reference to the User entity in order to send push notifications for upcoming appointments.

7. Create a DoctorFinder class with methods such as searchByLocation(location), searchBySpecialization(specialization), and searchByDistance(distance) to find doctors in a user's area based on different criteria.

8. Define the associations as follows:
   - UserAppointments class has a many-to-one association with the User class.
   - UserAppointments class has a many-to-one association with the Doctor class.
   - DoctorAppointments class has a many-to-one association with the User class.
   - DoctorAppointments class has a many-to-one association with the Doctor class.
   - MedicalHistory class has a many-to-one association with the User class.
   - Notification class has a many-to-one association with the User class.

9. Implement additional methods for classes and fine-tune specificities according to the application's requirements, such as searching, retrieving, updating, and deleting specific information.

This class diagram design encompasses the core functionalities of the mobile application, including booking appointments, tracking medical history, finding doctors, and receiving push notifications.
