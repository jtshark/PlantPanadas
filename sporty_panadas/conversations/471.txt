### Request: My project is a social media app that allows users to create an account, follow and unfollow each other, create posts with text and images, and interact with other users' posts through likes and comments.
### Expert 1: So, we have a user request for designing a UML class diagram for a social media app. It seems like there are several entities involved, such as users, posts, likes, and comments. Any thoughts on how we should start?

### Expert 2: Absolutely. Let's start by identifying the main entities and their relationships. We'll need a User class to represent the user accounts. I suggest including attributes like username, password, date of birth, and follower count.

### Expert 3: Sounds good. We should also think about how posts are related to users. I propose having a Post class with attributes like text, images, creation date, and perhaps even a location if we want to include geotagging.

### Expert 1: Agreed. We'll need a one-to-many relationship between users and posts, as a user can have multiple posts and a post belongs to only one user. So, in the User class, we could add a collection (like an array) of posts.

### Expert 2: Yes, and to represent interactions between users and posts, we should include classes for likes and comments. This would allow users to engage with posts.

### Expert 3: Good point. Each like should have a reference to the user who liked it and the post it belongs to. One way to do this is to have a Like class with user and post attributes to represent this association.

### Expert 1: Similarly, we could create a Comment class. It should have a user and post attribute as well, along with a text attribute to store the comment text. This way, each comment would know which user it belongs to and which post it relates to.

### Expert 2: Absolutely. Now, let's consider the relationships between these entities. A user can follow other users, so we could include an attribute in the User class to track the users they follow. We can use a collection of other User objects for this.

### Expert 3: Makes sense. We could also include a follower count attribute in the User class to keep track of how many followers a user has.

### Expert 1: Good idea. Additionally, since each post can have likes and comments, we may want to add attributes to house collections of likes and comments within the Post class. This way, each post would have its list of interactions.

### Expert 2: Agreed. Now, there's one thing that comes to mindâ€”should we include a separate class for images, or do we store them directly in the Post class?

### Expert 3: Storing potential images directly in the Post class might create unnecessary complexity. We could design an Image class that can be associated with a Post object. This way, each Post can have an optional Image, allowing flexibility.

### Expert 1: That could indeed simplify things. So, we'll have an Image class with attributes like a file name, size, and maybe even metadata, such as the uploader or the resolution.

### Expert 2: Great. Overall, it seems like we can structure our UML class diagram with classes for User, Post, Like, Comment, and Image. We'll need attributes and methods to appropriately represent these entities and their relationships.

### Expert 3: Exactly. But before finalizing this design, let's take a step back in case we missed something. Do you have any additional thoughts or information that could help us refine this diagram further?
### Instructions: 1. Start by creating a class for "User." Add attributes such as username, password, date of birth, and follower count.
2. Create a class for "Post." Include attributes like text, creation date, and location. Consider adding an optional association with the "Image" class.
3. Create a class for "Like." Include the attributes "user" referencing the User class and "post" referencing the Post class.
4. Create a class for "Comment." Add attributes for "user," referencing the User class, "post," referencing the Post class, and "text."
5. Create a class for "Image." Include attributes like the file name, size, and any relevant metadata.
6. Add a collection of Post objects within the User class to represent their posts.
7. Add a collection of User objects within the User class to track the users they follow (followees).
8. Add an integer attribute "followerCount" within the User class to keep track of the number of followers.
9. Add a collection of Like objects within the Post class to represent the likes received by that post.
10. Add a collection of Comment objects within the Post class to represent the comments made on that post.
11. Define associations between the Like class and the User class, and between the Comment class and the User class.
12. Define associations between the Like class and the Post class, and between the Comment class and the Post class (both associations should be separate from each other).
13. Consider adding appropriate navigability arrows for associations to indicate one-to-many relationships and their directionality.
14. Review and refine the class diagram to ensure clarity and completeness.
15. If needed, iterate on the class diagram based on additional requirements or specific improvements provided.
