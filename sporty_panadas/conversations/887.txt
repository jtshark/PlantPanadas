### Request: My project is to develop a website where customers can order food from various restaurants and have it delivered to their doorstep by hired drivers, while partnering restaurants manage their menus, orders, and deliveries.
### Expert 1: So it looks like we need to create a UML class diagram for a food delivery website. We'll need to represent the customers, restaurants, menus, orders, deliveries, and hired drivers. Does that sound about right?

### Expert 2: Yes, that seems to cover the main components of the system. Let's start by identifying the main classes we will need. I think we'll need a Customer class to represent the customers who place orders.

### Expert 3: Agreed. The restaurants will also have a crucial role in this system. We should have a class for Restaurant to represent them. Would each restaurant manage its own menu?

### Expert 1: That seems logical. So we'll add a Menu class associated with each Restaurant. The Menu class can have attributes such as menuItems, prices, and descriptions.

### Expert 2: Since customers will place orders, we'll need an Order class. This class will have an association with the Customer class and one with the Menu class to indicate which menu items are ordered.

### Expert 1: That's true. And once an order is placed, it needs to be delivered. So we'll need a Delivery class that has an association with the Order class and one with a Driver class for tracking the delivery progress.

### Expert 3: Right. So let's add a Driver class to represent the hired drivers. They would have information like name, contact details, and maybe even a photo.

### Expert 2: Additionally, we might want to consider a class called PartnerRestaurant to manage the information specific to the partnering restaurants, such as their contact and location details.

### Expert 1: Good point. That way we can capture the information that applies specifically to the partnering restaurants only.

### Expert 3: Great progress so far. Here's an additional feature we might want to consider. Since the website will allow customers to review restaurants and drivers, we should have review ratings associated with both Restaurant and Driver classes.

### Expert 2: Absolutely. That way we can quickly gather information about the quality of both the restaurant's food and the driver's service. It will be helpful to have those associations to see the overall ratings.

### Expert 1: I completely agree. And keeping those ratings separate also allows more flexibility in terms of analyzing and displaying the feedback to other users.

### Expert 3: Since this is a project involving website development, we will also need to consider classes like User and Authentication for user registration and login functionality. These might have associations with Customer, PartnerRestaurant, and Driver classes.

### Expert 2: Yes, definitely. And let's not forget the Location class to track the customer and restaurant locations for delivering the food accurately.

### Expert 1: Agreed. With the classes we discussed so far, we have a solid foundation for the UML class diagram. Of course, there may be additional attributes and methods that we need to consider based on specific requirements, but this should give us a good starting point.

### Expert 3: Absolutely. To ensure we capture all the necessary details, we should seek some clarifications from the user. Are there any additional attributes or behaviors they would like to see represented in the class diagram?

### Expert 1: Good idea. Let's add a few questions for clarification:

### QUESTION: Are there any specific attributes or behaviors that you would like to see in the Customer, Restaurant, Menu, Order, Delivery, and Driver classes? 
### Answer: 
Yes, for the Customer and Driver classes, I would like to add an “emergency contact” attribute, while I want to add a “deadline” attribute to the Delivery class to ensure on-time arrival. For restaurants I would like the ability to save forecast demand, and for order and menu there should be added attributes to indicate currency and discounts they provide.
### Expert 1: Thank you for providing those additional attributes. So we will add an "emergencyContact" attribute to both the Customer and Driver classes. This will allow us to store the necessary contact information in case of emergencies related to either the customer or the driver. 

### Expert 3: Makes sense. For the Delivery class, we will add a "deadline" attribute to ensure that deliveries are made on time. By having this attribute, we can track and monitor the expected arrival time and enforce timely deliveries.

### Expert 2: Good point. Now, you mentioned wanting to save forecast demand for the restaurants. We can create an attribute called "forecastDemand" in the Restaurant class to capture this information. With this attribute, we can help restaurants plan their inventory and staffing based on anticipated demand.

### Expert 1: And for the Order and Menu classes, we will add the "currency" attribute to represent the currency used for pricing of the orders and menu items.

### Expert 3: That's a good addition. And along with the currency attribute, we'll also include a "discount" attribute in both the Order and Menu classes. This will allow us to apply and display any discounts that might be available for specific orders and menu items.

### Expert 2: It would also be beneficial if the Order class had a method called "calculateTotalPrice" to calculate the total price at runtime by considering any applicable discounts.

### Expert 1: Yes, that's a great idea. The calculateTotalPrice method can utilize the discount attribute to provide accurate pricing information to the customers.

### Expert 3: Absolutely. It would be ideal if the calculateTotalPrice method leverages the menuItems association and their corresponding prices to compute the total price correctly.

### Expert 2: Agreed. By having a well-designed method for calculating the total price, we can avoid any discrepancies and make the ordering process more efficient for both the customers and the restaurants.

### Expert 1: With these additions, we should have an updated version of the UML class diagram that encompasses all the necessary attributes and behaviors specified by the user. Let's proceed with incorporating these changes. 

As experts, unless there are additional uncertainties or questions, we can continue working on the UML class diagram by incorporating the added attributes into their respective classes.
### Instructions: Below is a sequential solution for designing the UML class diagram based on the requirements and discussion:

1. Start by creating the following classes with their respective attributes:

- Customer: 
  - Attributes: name, address, emergencyContact
  
- Driver: 
  - Attributes: name, contactDetails, emergencyContact
  
- PartnerRestaurant: *new addition*
  - Attributes: name, address, contactDetails, forecastDemand
   
- Menu:
  - Attributes: menuItems, prices, descriptions, currency, discounts

- Order:
  - Attributes: customer, menu, currency, discounts (*already existing attributes*), status
  - Method: calculateTotalPrice()
	  
- Delivery:
  - Attributes: order, driver, deadline
	      	   
2. Add relationships (associations) between the classes:

- Connect Order to Customer with an association representing the customer who placed the order.
  
- Connect their menu (Menu) and partner weather (PartnerRestaurant) with an association to visually associate their relationship.

- Associate Menu with PartnerRestaurant to signify that each restaurant has a menu.
  
- Connect Delivery to Order with an association to represent the delivery assigned for that order.
  
- Connect Delivery to Driver with an association representing the assigned driver for the delivery.
  		   
3. Add additional attributes related to forecasting demand:			
		  
- In the PartnerRestaurant class, add the attribute "forecastDemand" to reflect demand forecasting capabilities.

4. Finally, add the "calculateTotalPrice()" method to the Order class in order to calculate the total price, using the currency and discounts associated with the order items.

That's it! Your UML class diagram is now designed based on the mentioned requirements.
