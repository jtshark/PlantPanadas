### Request: Our project is developing a mobile application for a food delivery service that allows customers to browse menus, select items and place orders, while restaurants manage order fulfillment and inventory control.
### Expert 1: So, we need to design a class diagram for a food delivery mobile application. This application will have two main actors: the customer who can browse menus, select items, and place orders, and the restaurant who manages order fulfillment and inventory control. Shall we start with the customer side?

### Expert 2: Yes, let's start with the customer. We will need a class to represent the customer itself, right? What attributes should we include?

### Expert 1: At the minimum, we'll need attributes such as customerID, fullName, email, and phone number to uniquely identify and contact the customer. Additionally, we can also have optional attributes like address, so that the delivery can be made to the correct location.

### Expert 3: It would also be useful to have a ShoppingCart class that allows us to represent the selected items before placing an order. This way, the customer can add items and remove them if needed.

### Expert 1: Absolutely, the ShoppingCart class is a good idea. It can have a list of Item objects representing the selected items, along with methods for adding and removing items. Additionally, we can include a method to calculate the current total price of the items in the cart.

### Expert 2: Speaking of Item, we should have a class to represent the individual items offered by restaurants. This class will include attributes like itemID, name, description, price, and possibly an image attribute.

### Expert 1: Right, and the Item class can also have some methods like getters for accessing attributes and maybe a function to check the availability of the item.

### Expert 3: One thing to consider is that different restaurants might have different ways of customizing the items they offer. For example, one restaurant might offer toppings for pizza, while another might offer different dressings for salads. How can we handle this?

### Expert 2: We can create a class called Customization that can represent these options. This class can have attributes like customizationID, name, and price. We can then have a List<Customization> attribute in the Item class to store these customizations.

### Expert 1: That would work well. Another thing to consider is the ordering history. We should include a class called Order that represents a completed order. It could have attributes like orderID, timePlaced, totalPrice, and maybe a status attribute to track whether the order is confirmed or delivered.

### Expert 3: Agreed, and the Order class can also have a reference to the ShoppingCart to capture the selected items for that specific order.

### Expert 2: On the restaurant side, we can include a class, such as Restaurant, to represent each individual restaurant. It can have attributes like restaurantID, name, address, and contact number.

### Expert 1: Yes, and since the restaurants need to manage their inventory, we can add a class called Inventory to keep track of the available items. The Inventory class can have attributes like itemID, itemName, and quantity available.

### Expert 3: Additionally, we can include a class called OrderFulfillment to handle order management for restaurants. This class can have methods such as confirmOrder(), processPayment(), and updateInventory().

### Expert 1: Right, and we can also include a class called Menu that represents the menu offered by each restaurant. The Menu class can have a list of Item objects to keep track of the items available at that particular restaurant.

### Expert 2: This all sounds pretty comprehensive. Before we conclude, should we add any additional functionality or classes?

### Expert 3: We might want to consider including a User class as a parent class for both the Customer and Restaurant classes. This way, we can define common attributes like userID and authentication credentials.

### Expert 1: That makes sense. We can also have subclasses for different types of users if needed, such as an Admin class to manage the entire system.

### Expert 2: Agreed. Additionally, we may want to include a Feedback class to capture customer feedback and ratings regarding their ordering experience or the quality of the food.

### Expert 3: That's a good suggestion. It might also be helpful to add a class to represent the DeliveryPerson who handles order delivery. This class could have attributes like deliveryPersonID, name, and contact information.

### Expert 1: Excellent. I think with this design, we've covered the main requirements for our food delivery mobile application. Are there any other specific aspects we need to consider?

### Expert 2: I can't think of anything else at the moment. And I believe this kind of design will allow us to meet the user's request of enabling customers to browse menus, select items, and place orders, while restaurants manage order fulfillment and inventory control.

### Expert 3: I agree. We've considered all the major components and interactions needed for the system. It should provide a solid foundation for implementing the mobile application.

### Expert 1: Great. Let's document this design and clarify any remaining doubts with the user if necessary. Once they approve it, we can proceed with the implementation.
### Instructions: 1. Start by creating a Customer class with attributes such as customerID (string), fullName (string), email (string), and phoneNo (string). Add an optional address (string) attribute if desired.

2. Create a ShoppingCart class. Add a List<Item> attribute to store the selected items and a totalPrice() method to calculate the current total price of the items. Include addItem(Item item) and removeItem(Item item) methods to add or remove items from the shopping cart.

3. Design an Item class with attributes including itemID (string), name (string), description (string), price (decimal), and an optional image attribute (string). Include a List<Customization> attribute to handle possible customizations and a isAvailable() method to check the availability of the item.

4. Implement a Customization class with attributes like customizationID (string), name (string), and price (decimal). No associations or methods are needed for this class.

5. Introduce an Order class. Create attributes orderID (string), timePlaced (datetime), totalPrice (decimal), and status (string) to represent the completed order's details. Add reference to ShoppingCart and associated getters and setters for placing and managing orders.

6. Create a Restaurant class with attributes like restaurantID (string), name (string), address (string), and contactNo (string) to represent restaurant details.

7. Design an Inventory class with attributes itemID (string), itemName (string), and quantity (int) available to keep track of available items.

8. Implement an OrderFulfillment class with methods like confirmOrder(Order order) to store and confirm order details, processPayment(Order order) for payment handling, and updateInventory(Order order) to update the inventory after successful order fulfillment.

9. Create a Menu class that represents the menu offered by each restaurant. Add a List<Item> attribute to capture the available items at a specific restaurant.

10. Introduce a User class as a parent class for both the Customer and Restaurant classes. Add attributes like userID (string) and authentication credentials (username and password) along with associated getters and setters. 

11. Add optional subclasses such as an Admin class to manage the entire system inheriting from the User class, if needed.

12. Optionally, create a Feedback class with attributes to capture customer feedback and ratings such as feedbackID (string), comment (string), and rating (double)

13. Optionally, implement a DeliveryPerson class with attributes like deliveryPersonID (string), name (string), and contact (string) to represent delivery personnel details.

Ensure that the classes and their associations are accurately evaluated and defined. Convey the class relationships using accurately defined associations such as aggregation, composition, or simple associations, based on the requirements documented during the discussion.
