### Request: Our project involves building a website to sell clothes online. Customers can browse through our catalogue, select items their size, colour and add to cart to purchase. The admin side will handle product management, order fulfilment and site content updates.
### Expert 1: So, let's start by brainstorming the different classes we will need for this website. I think we will definitely need a User class to represent the customers, and an Admin class for the site administrators. What do you think?

### Expert 2: Yes, I agree. The User class can have attributes like name, email, address, and maybe even a cart to keep track of the items they've added for purchase. The Admin class can have attributes specific to managing products and orders, such as privileges and access levels.

### Expert 3: Additionally, we will need a Product class to represent the items being sold. It should have attributes like name, price, colour, and size. It would also be a good idea to have attributes such as stock quantity and date added.

### Expert 1: Right, we also need some sort of representation for the items in the cart. How about a CartItem class with product and quantity attributes? The Cart class can then have a list of CartItems, along with methods to calculate the total price and manage the items.

### Expert 2: That sounds good. And what about an Order class? This class can have attributes like order number, order date, and customer information. It will also have a list of CartItems to represent the items being ordered.

### Expert 3: Agreed. We can also include attributes like order status and shipping details in the Order class. This way, the customer can track the progress of their order and the admin can handle the fulfilment process accordingly.

### Expert 1: I believe we also need a Category class to organize the products. Each product can belong to one or more categories, so the Category class can have attributes like name and a list of associated products.

### Expert 2: Yes, that makes sense. It will help customers navigate through the website and find products easily. We should consider adding methods to filter and search products based on category as well.

### Expert 3: One more class we might need is an Image class. Each Product can have multiple images associated with it. The Image class can have attributes like URL and alt text to display the product images.

### Expert 1: Good point! Including an Image class will enhance the graphical representation of the products and make the website more appealing to customers.

### Expert 2: Overall, I think we've covered the main classes needed for this website. We should also arrange the relationships between these classes - like the association between User and Cart, totaling of CartItems' prices in Cart, and the aggregation between Order and Cart.

### Expert 3: Absolutely, and I think we may also need to include some validation methods in the classes to ensure the data entered by users is correct, for example, verifying the stock quantity before placing an order or validating the user's email address.

### Expert 1: Agreed. With proper design, this UML class diagram will help us organize our code, ensure encapsulation, and make it easier to scale and maintain.

### Expert 2: Definitely. It will be essential to seek clarification from the user regarding any additional requirements or edge cases that may not be apparent.

### Expert 3: I can't think of any other missing classes or attributes at the moment. Once we have more information from the user, we can sit down and refine this diagram further.
### Instructions: 1. Start by creating the User class with the following attributes:
   - name: string
   - email: string
   - address: string
   Add appropriate getter and setter methods for these attributes.

2. Create the Admin class with the following attributes:
   - username: string
   - password: string
   - privileges: string
   Include appropriate getter and setter methods for these attributes.

3. Build the Product class with the following attributes:
   - name: string
   - price: decimal
   - color: string
   - size: string
   - stockQuantity: int
   - dateAdded: date
   Implement corresponding getter and setter methods for these attributes.

4. Construct the CartItem class with the following attributes:
   - product: Product (association to the Product class)
   - quantity: int
   Add getter and setter methods for these attributes.

5. Define the Cart class with attributes:
   - items: List<CartItem> (association to the CartItem class)

   Include the following methods:
   - totalItems(): int
   - getTotalPrice(): decimal
   - addItem(cartItem: CartItem): void
   - removeItem(cartItem: CartItem): void

6. Create the Order class with the following attributes:
   - orderNumber: string
   - orderDate: date
   - customer: User (association to the User class)
   - items: List<CartItem> (association to the CartItem class)
   - orderStatus: string
   - shippingDetails: string
   Set up corresponding getter and setter methods.

7. Establish the Category class with the following attributes:
   - name: string
   - products: List<Product> (association to the Product class)
   Implement getter and setter methods for these attributes.

8. Add the Image class with the following attributes:
   - url: string
   - altText: string
   Establish getter and setter methods accordingly.

9. Create appropriate methods in relevant classes to handle additional functionalities, such as validation for stock quantity and email address.

10. Establish necessary associations between the classes based on the following relations:
    - User has a Cart
    - Admin handles Product management
    - Cart has CartItems
    - Order includes CartItems
    - Product belongs to one or more Categories
    - Product has multiple Images

11. Review the structure to ensure that it covers all necessary attributes, methods, and relationships for the eCommerce website.

Note: Remember to ensure appropriate access modifiers, encapsulation, and proper design patterns while implementing the classes and their relationships.
