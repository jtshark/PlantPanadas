### Request: Our project is a social media app where users can post and share photos, videos, and messages, while being able to follow and interact with other users. It should also have options for privacy controls, hashtags, and notifications.
### Expert 1: So, we have a user request to design a class diagram for a social media app. It needs to support features such as posting and sharing photos, videos, and messages, following and interacting with other users, privacy controls, hashtags, and notifications. 

### Expert 2: That sounds like a typical social media app. We will definitely need classes to represent users and their posts. Let's start by identifying possible classes. Apart from the obvious ones like User and Post, I can think of classes like Photo, Video, Comment, Hashtag, and Notification.

### Expert 3: Yes, those classes seem appropriate. In addition to that, we will need classes like Like, Follow, and Message to represent the interactions between users. We might also need a class for PrivacyControl to handle privacy settings.

### Expert 1: That makes sense. To start with, let's look at the User class. We'll need attributes like username, password, full name, date of birth, and bio. Any additional attributes that we should consider?

### Expert 2: I think those attributes cover the basic information about the user. But we also need to think about how to handle followers and following. Should we include those attributes in the User class itself, or create separate classes for it?

### Expert 3: Good point. I think it would be better to create separate classes for followers and following. This way, it will be easier to manage and track the relationships between users. We can have a Follow class with attributes like follower, following, and date.

### Expert 1: Agreed. Now, let's move on to the Post class. It should have attributes like title, caption, creation date, and privacy level. Should we include separate classes for different types of posts, like Photo and Video?

### Expert 2: I think it would be more flexible to have separate classes for different types of posts. Each of these classes can inherit common attributes from the Post class and have their own specific attributes. For example, the Photo class can have attributes like width, height, and file format.

### Expert 3: That's a good approach. We can also consider having a separate Hashtag class to handle hashtags related to posts. This can be helpful for searching and categorizing posts based on topics.

### Expert 1: Great. Now, let's discuss the PrivacyControl class. Apart from basic privacy settings, what additional features should we consider?

### Expert 2: We can include attributes for specifying who can see the posts, such as friends-only or public. We might also need methods to handle blocking or reporting users for inappropriate behavior.

### Expert 3: Definitely. And for notifications, we can create a Notification class with attributes like type, message, and date. We can also consider different types of notifications, such as likes, comments, or friend requests.

### Expert 1: Sounds good. Before finalizing the class diagram, do we need any clarification from the user regarding anything?

### QUESTION: Should we include a separate Comment class for handling comments on posts? And would you like to have any additional features related to privacy controls or notifications? 
### Answer:  Yes please include a separate Comments class. For privacy controls, the ability to hide posts from certain users would be useful. For notifications, it might be helpful to be able to customize which types of notifications an enrolled user receives alert for e.g only comment/)reply or like alert.
### Expert 1: Thanks for the clarification. We will include a separate Comment class for handling comments on posts. 

### Expert 2: Regarding the privacy controls, we will add the ability to hide posts from specific users. This can be implemented by adding an attribute to the PrivacyControl class to handle the blocked users.

### Expert 3: Good suggestion. We'll also include the customization of notification preferences for each user, so they can choose which types of notifications they want to receive alerts for. This can be implemented with an attribute in the User class to specify their notification preferences.

### Expert 1: Great! With this information, I think we have a comprehensive understanding of the requirements. Let's finalize the class diagram. Are there any other aspects or concerns we should address before we proceed?

### Expert 2: I can't think of anything else at the moment. We managed to cover all the requested features and even included options for customization. It's shaping up nicely!

### Expert 3: Agreed. By considering separate classes for different types of posts and interactions, we provide room for extensibility and improved organization. I believe the user will have a great experience with the app based on this design.

### Expert 1: Excellent. I'll finalize the class diagram based on our discussion and make sure it captures all the essential components. Once the diagram is ready, we can move on to discussing the implementation details.

### Expert 2: Sounds like a plan. Let's reconvene once the class diagram is ready to have a detailed conversation about the implementation specifics.

### Expert 3: Looking forward to it. This has been a productive discussion, and I'm excited to see the design come to life.
### Instructions: 1. Create a Class diagram to represent the social media app.
2. Identify the main classes required for the app: User, Post, Photo, Video, Comment, Hashtag, Notification, Like, Follow, Message, and PrivacyControl.
3. Begin defining the attributes for each class:

- User class attributes:
  - username: String
  - password: String
  - fullName: String
  - dateOfBirth: Date
  - bio: String
  - privacyControl: PrivacyControl

- Post class attributes:
  - title: String
  - caption: String
  - creationDate: Date
  - privacyLevel: String
   
- Photo additional attributes:
  - width: Integer
  - height: Integer
  - fileFormat: String
  
- Comment class attributes:
  - content: String
  - commentDate: Date
   
- Hashtag class attributes:
  - name: String
   
- Notification class attributes:
  - type: String
  - message: String
  - date: Date

- Like, Follow, and Message classes don't need additional attributes.

4. Define the associations between classes:

- User has many Posts - aggregation/composition relationship
- User has many Comments - aggregation/composition relationship
- Post has many Comments - aggregation/composition relationship
- User can Like many Posts - association relationship
- User can Message/Follow many Users - association relationship
- User has many Notifications - aggregation/composition relationship

5. Consider adding associations related to privacy controls and notifications customization:

- User aggregates/composes PrivacyControl
- PrivacyControl can have a List of blockedUsers
- PrivacyControl can handle hiding posts from specific users
   
- User can Customize [0..1] notificationPreferences
- notificationPreferences can setPreferences for different notification types

6. Review the class diagram to ensure all the requested features are covered, including post sharing, interactions, privacy controls customization, and notification preferences.

7. Finalize the class diagram, ensuring all classes, attributes, and associations follow the requirements discussed.

With this complete class diagram, the team can now move forward and discuss the implementation details of the social media app based on the designed structure.
