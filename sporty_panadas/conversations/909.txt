### Request: Design a platform for a social media app that allows users to share photos, videos, and written content, as well as interact with other users through comments and liking/re-sharing features. Certain users (administrators) require additional functionality for managing the app's content and user base.
### Expert 1: Ok, let's start by analyzing the basic requirements for this social media app. It needs to allow users to share photos, videos, and written content, and also have features for interacting with other users such as comments, liking, and re-sharing. Additionally, there is a requirement for administrators who need additional functionality for managing content and users. 

### Expert 2: That covers most of the basic features. For the users, we should have a User class which will have attributes like username, password, email, and profile photo. We can also include methods like createPost, likePost, commentOnPost, and sharePost. 

### Expert 3: Agreed. Additionally, we need a Post class. This class will have attributes such as postContent, postAuthorId, and timestamp. It should have methods like addComment, likePost, and sharePost. This would make our class diagram more flexible and reusable.

### Expert 1: Good point. We should also consider implementing different types of posts, like text post, photo post, and video post. For each type, we can have subclasses inheriting from the Post class. The subclass can then have additional attributes and methods specific to that type of post.

### Expert 2: That's a great idea. We can have a TextPost subclass with additional attributes like title, and a PhotoPost subclass with an attribute for the actual photo file, etc. This way, we can easily add new post types in the future without modifying the base Post class.

### Expert 3: Yes, and what about the interaction between users and their posts? We may need an Association class here. Let's call it UserPostInteraction. It can have attributes like userId, postId, type (like, comment, or share), and a timestamp. We can also have an enumeration class to represent the type of the interaction.

### Expert 1: That's a good solution. It covers the basic interactions between users and posts. Moving on to the administration functionality, we will need an Administrator class. It should have methods for managing users and posts, such as deletePost and blockUser.

### Expert 2: I agree. To make the class diagram more maintainable, we can consider abstracting related functionalities into separate classes and make our class diagram more modular.

### Expert 3: Indeed. For example, we can have a UserManager class responsible for managing user-related functionality, like creating a user, deleting a user, and checking user activity.

### Expert 1: That's a good approach. It allows us to clearly separate responsibilities and makes our system more flexible and scalable. We can do the same for post-related functionalities, such as a PostManager class for managing post-related activities.

### Expert 2: To summarize, we will have a class diagram with classes such as User, Administrator, Post, TextPost, PhotoPost, VideoPost, UserPostInterac
### Instructions: Step-by-Step Solution:

1. Create a User class with attributes: 
   - username: String
   - password: String
   - email: String
   - profilePhoto: File
   
2. Create methods in the User class:
   - createPost(content: String, type: PostType): Post
   - likePost(post: Post)
   - commentOnPost(post: Post, content: String)
   - sharePost(post: Post, message: String)

3. Create a Post class with attributes:
   - id: String
   - content: String
   - author: User
   - timestamp: DateTime
   
4. Create subclasses of Post for different post types:
   - TextPost: Inherits from Post
     - Add attribute: title: String
     
   - PhotoPost: Inherits from Post
     - Add attribute: photoFile: File
     
   - VideoPost: Inherits from Post
     - Add attribute: videoFile: File

5. Create an Enumerated class to represent the type of user-post interaction:
   - UserPostInteractionType (Like, Comment, Share)
   
6. Create an Association class called UserPostInteraction with attributes:
   - user: User
   - post: Post
   - interactionType: UserPostInteractionType
   - timestamp: DateTime

7. Create an Administrator class with methods for managing users and posts:
   - deletePost(post: Post)
   - blockUser(user: User)

8. Create a UserManager class responsible for managing user-related functionality:
   - createUser(username: String, password: String, email: String, profilePhoto: File): User
   - deleteUser(user: User)
   - checkActivity(user: User): Boolean

9. Create a PostManager class responsible for managing post-related activities:
   - addComment(post: Post, content: String)
   - deleteComment(post: Post, comment: Comment)
   - deletePost(post: Post)

Remember, this class diagram is a high-level representation of the different classes and their relationships within the app. The actual implementation may require additional classes, attributes, or methods based on specific requirements and technologies used.
