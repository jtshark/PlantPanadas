### Request: My project is to create a website for a new restaurant that displays their menu, allows customers to make reservations, and showcases the restaurant's ambience through photos and descriptions.
### Expert 1: So, for this project, we need to design a UML class diagram that represents the different components of the website for the new restaurant. Let me start by summarizing the requirements. We need to display the menu, allow customers to make reservations, and showcase the restaurant's ambience through photos and descriptions. Any initial thoughts on how we should structure our class diagram?

### Expert 2: I think we should start by identifying the main classes that will be involved in the website functionality. Based on the requirements, we can have classes like Menu, Reservation, Restaurant, Photo, and Description.

### Instructions: Solution:

Step 1: Create Class "Menu":
   - Add attributes: 
     - _menuItems: List<MenuItem>
   - Add methods:
     - addMenuItem(menuItem: MenuItem)
     - removeMenuItem(menuItem: MenuItem)

Step 2: Create Class "MenuItem":
   - Add attributes: 
     - _name: String
     - _description: String
     - _price: Double

Step 3: Create Class "Reservation":
   - Add attributes: 
     - _customerName: String
     - _reservationDate: Date
     - _tableNumber: Integer
   - Add methods:
     - setTableNumber(tableNumber: Integer)
     - cancelReservation()

Step 4: Create Class "Restaurant":
   - Add attributes: 
     - _name: String
     - _address: String
   - Add methods:
     - setName(name: String)
     - setAddress(address: String)

Step 5: Create Class "Photo":
   - Add attributes: 
     - _title: String
     - _imageUrl: String

Step 6: Create Class "Description":
   - Add attribute: 
     - _text: String

Step 7: Define Associations:
   - Association between Class "Restaurant" and Class "Menu" (1-to-1):
     - Add an arrow from "Restaurant" to "Menu" indicating the association.

   - Association between Class "Menu" and Class "MenuItem" (1-to-many):
     - Add an arrow from "Menu" to "MenuItem" indicating the association.
     - Add a * notation near the "MenuItem" end of the association.

   - Association between Class "Restaurant" and Class "Photo" (1-to-many):
     - Add an arrow from "Restaurant" to "Photo" indicating the association.
     - Add a * notation near the "Photo" end of the association.

   - Association between Class "Restaurant" and Class "Description" (1-to-many):
     - Add an arrow from "Restaurant" to "Description" indicating the association.
     - Add a * notation near the "Description" end of the association.

   - Association between Class "Restaurant" and Class "Reservation" (1-to-many):
     - Add an arrow from "Restaurant" to "Reservation" indicating the association.
     - Add a * notation near the "Reservation" end of the association.

Congratulations! Your UML class diagram is now complete, representing the various components needed for the website of the new restaurant.
