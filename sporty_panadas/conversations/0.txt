### Request: Our project is to design a mobile application where users can search and chat with nearby people based on their interests, while also being able to manage their profiles and view messages.
### Expert 1: It sounds like we'll need a few key classes for this application. Would you agree?
### Expert 2: Absolutely. Let's start with the User class. It will have attributes like name, age, and interests.
### Expert 3: Agreed. Additionally, we should include attributes for email, location, and perhaps a profile picture as well. And of course, a unique identifier like ID would be useful.
### Expert 1: We'll also need a class to represent messages. Any suggestions on what we should include in that class?
### Expert 2: We can have attributes like senderID, receiverID, message body, and a timestamp to keep track of when the message was sent.
### Expert 3: Good points. To facilitate the searching functionality, we'll need a class for managing interests. Users should be able to add, remove, and update their interests, don't you think?
### Expert 1: Definitely. The Interest class could have attributes like interestName and maybe a description. Users can then add interests to their profiles.
### Expert 2: Agreed. And for the actual searching, we'll need another class. Let's call it Search. It should have methods to search for nearby people based on specific interests or parameters.
### Expert 3: Sounds good. We should also have a class for managing profiles. This class will allow users to edit their profiles, upload/change profile pictures, view their own profile, and maybe even delete their profile.
### Expert 1: Perfect. So the Profile class could have attributes like profilePicture, bio, phone number, and maybe even a link to any social media accounts the user wants to share.
### Expert 2: Yes, and we can add methods like updateProfilePicture() and deleteProfile(). It might also be useful to add a method to validate that a user profile is complete before saving it.
### Expert 3: Agreed. And finally, we should have a class to represent the Chat functionality. This class can handle sending and receiving messages, manage message history, and perhaps handle message encryption and security.
### Expert 1: I agree, and we can include methods like sendMessage(), getMessages(), and maybe even encryptMessage() in the Chat class.
### Expert 2: That covers the main classes we discussed. Are there any additional requirements we need to consider?
### Expert 3: One thing that comes to mind is a class to handle geo-location. This would allow us to track the distance between users, display nearby users on a map, and apply filters for searching within a certain radius.
### Expert 1: That's a great point. How do you envision this class interacting with the others?
### Expert 2: We can store the user's coordinates in their User profile. Then, when searching for nearby people, we can calculate the distance between two sets of coordinates using a formula like Haversine.
### Expert 3: Agreed. It might also be helpful to have a method in the Search class that takes a user's location and returns nearby users within a certain radius.
### Expert 1: Sounds like a plan. I think we've covered the key classes for this user request. If we have any further uncertainties, we can ask the user for clarification. Great job, team!
### Instructions: 1. Create a User class with attributes:
   - ID (unique identifier for each user)
   - Name
   - Age
   - Email
   - Location
   - Profile picture

2. Create an Interests class with attributes:
   - InterestName
   - Description
  
3. Add a list attribute to the User class to store the user's interests.
 
4. Create a Messages class with attributes:
   - SenderID
   - ReceiverID
   - MessageBody
   - Timestamp
  
5. Implement a Search class with methods:
   - searchByLocation(User user, double radius): Searches for nearby users within a given radius and returns the search results.
   - searchByInterest(List<User> users, String interest): Searches for users based on their interests and returns the search results.
  
6. Implement a Profile class with attributes:
   - UserID
   - Bio
   - Phone number 
   - Link to social media accounts
   
7. Modify the User class byadding:
   - A profile attribute of type Profile
   - A list of messages attribute to keep track of received and sent messages.

8. Implement a Chat class with methods:
   - sendMessage(User sender, User receiver, String messageBody): Sends a message from one user to another.
   - getReceivedMessages(User user): Retrieves all the messages received by a specific user.
   - getSentMessages(User user): Retrieves all the messages sent by a specific user.
   - encryptMessage(String messageBody): Encrypts the message body for secure communication.

9. Add associations between classes:
   - User class has a one-to-one association with Profile class and a one-to-many association with Messages class.
   - User class has a many-to-many association with Interests class.
   - Search class has dependencies on User, Profile and Interests classes.
   - Chat class has associations with User and Messages classes.

10. Create a GeoLocation class with attributes:
    - Longitude
    - Latitude 

11. Add a GeoLocation attribute to the User class.

Note: These steps should provide a solid foundation for designing the class diagram. Remember to consider customizations and additional functionalities as needed for your specific implementation.
