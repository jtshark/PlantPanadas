### Request: My project is a website for a fictional café that will showcase menu items, allow customers to place orders, reserve tables, and apply discounts.
### Expert 1: So, our task is to design a UML class diagram for a website that will cater to a café. We need to consider showcasing menu items, order placement, table reservation, and applying discounts. Any initial thoughts?

### Expert 2: Firstly, we should identify the main entities in our scenario. The obvious ones are Menu, Customer, Order, Table, and Discount. These will be our major classes.

### Expert 3: Right, so let's start with the Menu class. It would contain attributes like item name, description, price, and maybe an image. We might also have methods like retrieveMenuItems() to get the entire menu.

### Expert 1: That sounds good. Then we need a class to represent the customers. We'll have attributes like name, email, and phone number. But should we also include an attribute for the customer's password for easy login?

### Expert 2: Adding a password attribute directly to the Customer class might be a security risk. It's best to keep authentication concerns separate. We can create an Auth class to handle login and have a relationship "Has a" between Customer and Auth.

### Expert 3: Agreed. As for orders, we can have an Order class that has a one-to-many association with both Customer and Menu, representing which customer placed the order and the items they ordered.

### Expert 1: Yes, and it might be useful to have an attribute for the order status, like "confirmed" or "completed". And perhaps, a method like cancelOrder().

### Expert 2: Absolutely. Now onto table reservations. We can create a Table class, which would have attributes like table number, capacity, and status (booked or available). And we'd need a reference to the Customer who made the reservation. Would that work?

### Expert 3: It sounds about right. Just one more thing to consider: discounts. Instead of having a separate Discount class, we can include a discount attribute in the Menu class. This way, we only need one class to store both the regular and discounted prices.

### Expert 1: That's a good point. It simplifies things, and we can have a method like getDiscountedPrice() in the Menu class to calculate the final price while considering the discount.

### Expert 2: Precisely. We also need to account for multiple discounts being applicable at once, such as a combo deal or happy hour discounts. We could have a Discount class that relates to the Menu class, storing details like the discount type and percentage.

### Expert 3: Great idea. And if we encounter any more uncertainties or ambiguities, we should make sure to seek user clarification before finalizing our diagram.

### Expert 1: Absolutely. Let's keep an eye out for any potential questions we might need to ask the user as we continue this design process.

### Expert 2: Agreed. For now, I think we have a good start on designing the UML class diagram for this café website scenario. Let's continue fleshing it out and see if any more questions come up along the way.

### Expert 3: Perfect. This should help us form a solid foundation for our overall design.
### Instructions: Solution:

1. Create a Menu class with attributes such as itemName, description, price, and image. Include methods like retrieveMenuItems() to get the complete menu list.

2. Create a Customer class with attributes like name, email, and phoneNumber. Avoid storing the password directly in the Customer class for security reasons. Instead, create an Auth class to handle customer login/authentication.

3. Create an Order class with attributes like orderStatus and references to both the Customer and Menu classes. Include methods like cancelOrder() to manage order status.

4. Design a Table class with attributes like tableNumber, capacity, and status (booked or available). Include a reference to the Customer class to track table reservations.

5. Include a discount attribute in the Menu class, instead of having a separate Discount class, to store regular and discounted prices. Implement a method like getDiscountedPrice() in the Menu class to calculate the final price.

6. For scenarios requiring multiple discounts (combo deal, happy hour), create a Discount class related to the Menu class. Define attributes like discountType and percentage to store discount details.

Remember to seek clarification from user/stakeholders for any ambiguous aspects during the design process.
