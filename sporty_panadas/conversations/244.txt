### Request: Design a social media app where users can post and share photos, videos, and messages with friends and followers, featuring personalized pages, search and discovery, notifications, messaging and chat features.
### Expert 1: So, we need to design a class diagram for a social media app. It should have features like photo and video sharing, personalized pages, search, messaging, and notifications. 

### Expert 2: Right, let's start by identifying the main classes we'll need. We can have classes like User, Post, Photos, Videos, Page, Search, Notification, Message, and Chat.

### Expert 3: That sounds like a good start. Let's begin with the User class. It should have attributes like username, password, email, and friends. We'll also need methods for creating a post, sharing a post, and sending messages.

### Expert 1: Absolutely. We should also include attributes like first name, last name, and bio in the User class to personalize the user's page. It would also be useful to include lists to store the user's uploaded photos and videos.

### Expert 2: Good call. Let's also create a Post class that represents each individual post. It can have attributes like post ID, content (textual description), and timestamps for both post creation and modification.

### Expert 3: Agreed. To enable photo and video sharing, we could create separate classes for Photos and Videos. These classes can have attributes like file name, file type, file size, and location.

### Expert 1: That makes sense. Moving on, for the personalized pages, we can create a Page class. This class should have attributes like page ID, owner (which is a User object), followers, and content specific to the page, such as a description or category.

### Expert 2: Right. And to manage search and discovery, we can have a Search class. It can contain methods for implementing search functions, like searching for posts, users, or specific hashtags.

### Expert 3: I agree with that. Additionally, we should also have a Notification class that can store attributes like notificationID, recipient (which is a User object), and content. This way, users can be notified about new post activities or interactions.

### Expert 1: Exactly. We should also create a Message class to handle one-on-one chats between users. It can have attributes like sender, receiver, message content, and a timestamp.

### Expert 2: Great idea. Lastly, let's create a Chat class to handle group chats or chat rooms. The Chat class can have attributes like chat ID, participants, and messages (which can be a collection of Message objects).

### Expert 3: That covers most of the functionality. Are there any methods we're missing?

### Expert 1: It looks like we need another method in the User class -- a method to like or comment on a post. We can also add methods to follow and unfollow other users.

### Expert 2: Additionally, we should include methods in the Page class to allow users to follow or unfollow a page and receive notifications about that page's activities.

### Expert 3: Good catch. And for the Search class, we'll need methods to search for users, posts, or hashtags based on specific criteria. This will make the search feature more versatile.

### Expert 1: Agreed. Shall we wrap up and summarize our class diagram design?

### Expert 2: Sure. Let's review our classes and their main attributes and relationships:

- 
### Instructions: 1. Create a User class with the following attributes: 
- username: string
- password: string
- email: string
- firstName: string
- lastName: string
- bio: string

2. Add a friends attribute to the User class, which is a list of User objects.

3. Implement methods in the User class:
- createPost(content: string): create a new Post object with the given content and associate it with the User.
- sharePost(post: Post): add the given Post object to the list of user's shared posts.
- sendMessage(receiver: User, content: string): create a new Message object with the given content and sender/receiver information.

4. Create a Post class with the following attributes:
- postId: string
- content: string
- createdTimestamp: timestamp
- modifiedTimestamp: timestamp

5. Adapt the User class to add a likes and comments attribute, which should be lists of Post objects, making this a many-to-many relationship.

6. Create a Photos class with the following attributes:
- filename: string
- fileType: string
- fileSize: integer
- location: string

7. Create a Videos class with the following attributes:
- filename: string
- fileType: string
- fileSize: integer
- location: string

8. Modify the User class to include photoList and videoList attributes as lists of Photo and Video objects.

9. Create a Page class with the following attributes:
- pageId: string
- owner: User object
- followers: list of User objects
- description: string

10. Create a Search class with methods:
- searchPosts(criteria: string): return a list of matching Post objects.
- searchUsers(criteria: string): return a list of matching User objects.
- searchHashtags(criteria: string): return a list of matching hashtag strings.

11. Create a Notifications class with the attributes:
- notificationId: string
- recipient: User object
- content: string

12. Create a Message class with attributes:
- sender: User object
- receiver: User object
- content: string
- timestamp: timestamp

13. Create a Chat class with the attributes:
- chatId: string
- participants: list of User objects
- messages: list of Message objects

14. Expand the User class to include the following methods:
- likePost(post: Post): add the given post to the user's likes list.
- commentOnPost(post: Post): add a comment to the given post.

15. Add methods to the Page class:
- followPage(page: Page): add the given Page object to the user's list of followed pages.
- unfollowPage(page: Page): remove the given Page object from the user's list of followed pages.

16. Add a method to the Search class:
- searchPages(criteria: string): return a list of matching Page objects.

17. Optionally, implement additional methods based on app requirements and features.
