### Request: We need an UML model for a shopping mobile app, where users can search for and purchase items, track orders, and receive notifications regarding sales.
### Expert 1: So we need to design a UML class diagram for a shopping mobile app. It seems like we have three main functionalities - searching and purchasing items, tracking orders, and receiving notifications. Any suggestions on how we should approach this?

### Expert 2: I think we should start by identifying the main actors in this system. Apart from the obvious ones like users and administrators, we should also consider potential actors such as sellers and delivery services.

### Expert 3: That makes sense. Let's start with the user and create a class for them. We can include attributes like name, email, and password. Additionally, we can have navigation methods like searchItems and purchaseItem.

### Expert 1: Agreed. And to support tracking orders, we would need additional classes like Order and Product. The Order class can have attributes like orderId, orderDate, and status, along with methods like trackOrder and cancelOrder, to help users in managing their purchases.

### Expert 2: Absolutely. We also need to consider the fact that users can receive notifications regarding sales.

### Expert 3: Yes, we should have a Notification class that includes attributes such as notificationId, message, and timestamp. This class can also have methods like viewNotification.

### Expert 1: Good. To encapsulate the sales functionality, we can have a separate Sales class. It can have method generateSalesReport that generates a report for the admin on the sales made during a specific time period.

### Expert 2: Right. And to handle the items themselves, we could have a Product class. It can have attributes like productId, name, price, description, and quantity, along with a purchaseProduct method.

### Expert 3: Just one question, shall we include an attribute for discounted price?

### Expert 1: It's generally current practice to include a price attribute and calculate the discounted price dynamically. This way, any changes to the discount percentage can be applied to the price attribute, and we don't need to modify or store an additional value for each product. Additionally, we can include a method called getDiscountedPrice which calculates the discounted price based on the current discount.

### Expert 3: Great explanation. That makes a lot of sense.

### Expert 2: Moving on, for the search functionality, we could have a separate Search class that has a method to search for products based on given criteria like name or category.

### Expert 1: Absolutely, and based on the search results, the user may want to add the items to their cart. So we should also have a Cart class. It can have methods like addItem, removeItem, and clearCart.

### Expert 3: Shouldn't we include a functionality for the user to view their cart as well?

### Expert 2: Yes, let's include a viewCart method in the Cart class. This method can display the list of items in the cart along with their quantities and prices.

### Expert 1: Good point. We also need to have a class called Delivery for the delivery service. This class can have attributes like deliveryId and address, along with a deliverOrder method.

### Expert 2: Since different users may have different addresses, should we include a separate class for user addresses?

### Expert 3: It's not necessary to create a separate class for user addresses, we can include an address attribute within the User class itself.

### Expert 1: I agree. Including an address attribute in the User class will simplify the model.

### Expert 2: Great, that covers the main functionalities. Also, should we consider including feedback and reviews for products?

### Expert 3: Yes, we can have a separate class called Review, with attributes like reviewId, rating, comment, and userId. The Review class can also have methods like submitReview and viewReviews.

### Expert 1: That's a good addition. It allows users to provide feedback on products and help future purchasers make informed decisions.

### Expert 2: I think we've covered all the major functionalities. Is there anything we missed?

### Expert 3: We should consider adding an Admin class to handle administrative tasks like managing products, users, and sales. The Admin class can have methods like addProduct, deleteUser, and generateSalesReport.

### Expert 1: excellent suggestion. Having a separate Admin class will compartmentalize user privileges and manage system settings efficiently.

### Expert 2: I think we have covered all the necessary classes and their functionalities as per the user request.

### Expert 3: Agreed. With these classes in place, we can produce a solid UML class diagram for the shopping mobile app.
### Instructions: Here is a step-by-step solution for designing the UML class diagram for the shopping mobile app:

1. Identify and create the User class:
   - Add attributes: name, email, password
   - Add navigation methods: searchItems(), purchaseItems()

2. Create the Order class:
   - Add attributes: orderId, orderDate, status
   - Add methods: trackOrder(), cancelOrder()

3. Create the Notification class:
   - Add attributes: notificationId, message, timestamp
   - Add methods: viewNotification()

4. Create the Sales class:
   - Add method: generateSalesReport() (for the admin)

5. Create the Product class:
   - Add attributes: productId, name, price, description, quantity
   - Include methods like purchaseProduct() and getDiscountedPrice()

6. Create the Search class:
   - Include method to search for products based on criteria

7. Create the Cart class:
   - Include methods: addItem(), removeItem(), clearCart(), and viewCart()

9. Create the Delivery class:
   - Add attributes: deliveryId, address
   - Include method: deliverOrder()

10. Add association and roles between classes:
    - User has a Cart (association)
    - User places Order (association)
    - User receives Notification (association)
    - User performs search using Search class (association)
    - User purchases Product from Cart

11. If desired, create the Review class:
    - Add attributes: reviewId, rating, comment, userId
    - Include methods like submitReview() and viewReviews()

12. Create the Admin class (optional) for administrative tasks:
    - Include methods: addProduct(), deleteUser(), and generateSalesReport()

With these steps, you should be able to accurately design the class diagram for the shopping mobile app, incorporating the functionalities discussed during the initial conversation.
