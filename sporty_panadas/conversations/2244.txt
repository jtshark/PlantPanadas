### Request: Our project is to build a subscription-based website that will educate and train individuals on different fitness routines.
### Expert 1: So, to get started with designing the UML class diagram for our fitness training website, let's gather some requirements. It's a subscription-based platform where users can access fitness routines. What classes do you think we should include?

### Expert 2: We'll definitely need a User class to represent the subscribers of our website. They will have personal information and their subscription details.

### Expert 3: Agreed. And we'll need a FitnessRoutine class as well, which will contain information about each individual routine, including the key exercises, duration, and difficulty level.

### Expert 1: Do you think we should include any other classes related to subscription management or user progress?

### Expert 3: Yes, we should add a Subscription class that keeps the record of the user's chosen subscription plan and payment status. This way, we can manage their access rights.

### Expert 2: I also think we can add a Progress class to track each user's fitness progress. It can store information such as weight, body measurements, and performance records.

### Expert 1: Looks like we have a good start. Should we include any association between these classes?

### Expert 3: Yes, there should be a "has-a" relationship between User and Subscription because each user will have a subscription plan. Also, we can have an "owns" relationship between User and Progress, as each user will have their own progress data.

### Expert 2: Additionally, there should be an "uses" relationship between User and FitnessRoutine so that users can access the routines.

### Expert 1: Great! Now, do we have anything else to clarify or inquire about?

Question: Regarding the FitnessRoutine class, would it be beneficial to include a Many-to-Many association between FitnessRoutines and Users? This would allow users to track and save their favorite routines. Should we do that?

### Instructions: Solution:

Step 1: Create a User class
- Define attributes: 
  - username: string 
  - password: string 
  - email: string 
  - subscription: Subscription

Step 2: Create a Subscription class
- Define attributes:
  - plan: string 
  - paymentStatus: string

Step 3: Create a Progress class
- Define attributes: 
  - weight: float 
  - bodyMeasurements: list of floats 
  - performanceRecords: list of strings

Step 4: Create a FitnessRoutine class
- Define attributes: 
  - exercises: list of strings 
  - duration: int 
  - difficultyLevel: string

Step 5: Create associations between classes
- Create a "has-a" association from User to Subscription
- Create an "owns" association from User to Progress
- Create a "uses" association from User to FitnessRoutine

Step 6: Answering the question about a Many-to-Many association
- Add a many-to-many association between FitnessRoutine and User with an intermediary class FavoriteRoutine. This allows users to save their favorite routines.
- Define the FavoriteRoutine class:
    - Define attributes:
      - user: User 
      - routine: FitnessRoutine
     
This completes the UML class diagram design for our fitness training website.
