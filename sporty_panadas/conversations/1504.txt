### Request: Our project is to build a mobile calendar app where customers can schedule and manage their appointments easily. It should also allow appointment reminders and sync with their existing calendars.
### Expert 1: So, for our mobile calendar app, we'll primarily need a class to represent appointments. And we should also consider classes for customers and calendars.

### Expert 2: That makes sense. Let's start with the Appointment class. I think we'll need attributes like the date and time, duration, and maybe a title for the appointment.

### Expert 3: Agreed. And we should also include a reminder attribute to cater to the user's request for appointment reminders.

### Expert 1: Good point. We can add a boolean attribute called hasReminder, which will be set to true if a reminder is needed. 

### Expert 2: Should we include an attribute to link the appointment to a specific customer?

### Expert 1: Yes, definitely. It seems logical to have a reference to the Customer class. This way, we can track which customer the appointment belongs to.

### Expert 3: We will also need to manage multiple calendars. Instead of linking each appointment to one specific calendar, it might be better to include a collection of calendars within the Calendar class, and each calendar can hold multiple appointments.

### Expert 1: That's a good point. Now, regarding the Customer class - besides the obvious attributes like name and contact info, should we include any other details?

### Expert 2: I think it would be useful to store the customer's email address. This way, we can send appointment confirmations and reminders via email.

### Expert 3: Additionally, we could include their time zone information. Since our app is likely to be accessed by users across different zones, we can tailor reminder notifications according to their time zone.

### Expert 1: Good call. Now, let's focus on the Calendar class. It would mainly handle the management of appointments for each user.

### Expert 2: Agreed. I would say each Calendar object should have a list of appointments, as well as methods to add, remove, and edit appointments.

### Expert 3: It would also make sense to provide a method for syncing the calendar with the user's existing calendar to ensure they don't miss any other preexisting appointments.

### Expert 1: Definitely. We can add a sync method that takes care of updating the mobile app's calendar with any changes made in their linked external calendars.

### Expert 2: I wonder if we should include a separate class to handle the reminder functionality or just have it as a method within the Appointment class.

### Expert 3: If the required reminder functionality is simple, I think having a method within the Appointment class should suffice. However, if it becomes more complex, such as sending notifications via different channels, then a separate Reminder class might be warranted.

### Expert 1: Agreed. We should gather more detailed requirements from the user to determine the specific behavior of the reminders. This way, we can ensure that we design the most appropriate class structure.
### Instructions: Step-by-step solution for the class diagram design:

1. Create a new class diagram.
2. Add the following classes: Customer, Appointment, and Calendar.
3. Define the attributes for the Customer class:
   - Name: String
   - Email: String
   - TimeZone: String
4. Define the attributes for the Appointment class:
   - Title: String
   - Date: Date
   - Time: Time
   - Duration: int
   - HasReminder: boolean
5. Create an association between Appointment and Customer classes (Customer has many Appointments).
6. Define the attributes for the Calendar class:
   - Appointments: List<Appointment>
7. Add methods to the Calendar class:
   - addAppointment(appointment: Appointment): void
   - removeAppointment(appointment: Appointment): void
   - editAppointment(oldAppointment: Appointment, newAppointment: Appointment): void
   - syncWithExternalCalendar(): void
8. Create an association between Calendar and Appointment classes (Calendar has many Appointments).
9. Define any additional methods as needed for the Appointment class:
   - setReminder(minutesBefore: int): void
10. If needed, create a separate Reminder class with appropriate attributes and methods to handle more complex reminders.
11. Review the class diagram design.
12. Make any necessary modifications or refinements based on additional requirements or analysis.
13. Save and share the final class diagram.
