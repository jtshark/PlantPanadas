### Request: Develop a mobile app that allows users to track their food intake and monitor their daily macros in order to lead a healthier lifestyle.
### Expert 1: So, we've been given a request to develop a mobile app that helps users track their food intake and monitor their daily macro intakes for a healthier lifestyle.

### Expert 2: That's a great feature to have in an app. It seems like we'll need to design a database to store the food items and track the macros. The user will be able to log their food consumption, and the app will calculate the macro totals for them.

### Expert 3: Absolutely, I think we should start by identifying the primary entities in our system and how they are related.

### Expert 1: Agreed. We'll need a User entity to represent the app's users and a Food entity to represent the food items they consume. The User entity will have a one-to-many relationship with the Food entity since a user can consume multiple food items.

### Expert 2: That sounds good. We'll also need attributes like name, age, height, weight in the User entity to calculate the required daily macronutrient targets for each user.

### Expert 3: Yes, and I think it's a good idea to have a separate entity for tracking the macros as well, let's call it MacroTracker. Each User will have an associated MacroTracker instance to store their daily macro statistics.

### Expert 1: During monsoon season, certain fruits like mangoes and bananas may go out of stock or become more expensive due to supply chain disruptions. It might be useful to add an optional attribute called AvailableFruits in the Food entity, which indicates which fruits are currently available.

### Expert 2: Yes, I agree. Users can avoid searching for unavailable fruits and focus on what they can actually consume. Plus, we should include the nutrient composition of each food as attributes in the Food entity.

### Expert 3: Definitely, and we should also include a Date attribute in the Food entity, representing when the food item was consumed.

### Expert 1: Along with the attributes to store a user's daily macronutrient targets in the MacroTracker entity, we should also include attributes to track the actual macronutrient intake of a user. That way, we can compare it to their targets and provide necessary feedback.

### Expert 2: We should add a relationship between the User and MacroTracker entities to represent that every User has one associated MacroTracker instance. This will allow us to provide personalized macro-tracking for each user.

### Expert 3: And don't forget about additional methods for calculating and displaying each user's daily macro intake based on the recorded food consumption. This will help them keep track of their progress easily.

### Expert 1: That makes sense. We can include a method in the MacroTracker entity called calculateMacros() that would loop through the associated Food items, summing up their nutrient composition, and display the totals.

### Expert 2: Exactly. So, our User entity will have a one-to-many relationship with both the Food and MacroTracker entities. The MacroTracker entity will also have attributes for tracking the daily macronutrient targets and the actual intake.

### Expert 3: Sounds good. Just one clarification we should seek from the user - How do they want to monitor the macronutrient intake? Do they want a visual representation or just the summation of the values?

### Expert 1: Good question. Let's ensure we get that clarified. What kind of visualization or representation should we provide for monitoring the macronutrient intake in the app?


### Instructions: Step-by-Step Solution:

1. Create a User class with the following attributes:
   - name: string
   - age: integer
   - height: float
   - weight: float

2. Create a Food class with the following attributes:
   - name: string
   - nutrientComposition: List of nutrient objects

3. Create a MacroTracker class with the following attributes:
   - dailyMacroTargets: MacroTargets object
   - dailyMacroIntake: MacroIntake object
   - date: string (representing the date of the tracked macros)

4. Create a MacroTargets class with the following attributes:
   - proteinTarget: float
   - carbTarget: float
   - fatTarget: float

5. Create a MacroIntake class with the following attributes:
   - proteinIntake: float
   - carbIntake: float
   - fatIntake: float

6. Create associations between classes:
   - User has a one-to-many relationship with Food (an attribute in the User class)
   - User also has a one-to-one relationship with MacroTracker (an attribute in the User class)
   - MacroTracker has a one-to-one relationship with MacroTargets and MacroIntake (both attributes in the MacroTracker class)

7. Optionally, add an AvailableFruits attribute in the Food class to indicate which fruits are currently available.

8. Include a method in the MacroTracker class called calculateMacros() that calculates the daily macro intakes based on the recorded food consumption.

9. Add a Date attribute in the Food class to represent when the food item was consumed, and another Date attribute in the MacroTracker class to represent the tracked date.

10. Determine the desired approach for monitoring the macronutrient intake and update the design accordingly. You can add visualization attributes/methods to provide visual representation or stick to displaying the summation of values as required by the user.
