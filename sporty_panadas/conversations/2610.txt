### Request: We need a UML model for our project of developing a mobile app that allows users to easily schedule and track their daily water intake, remind them with notifications, and view their progress over time.
### Expert 1: So, we have the user's requirement to develop a mobile app for tracking water intake. This app should have features for scheduling, notifications, and progress tracking. Based on this, let's start designing our UML class diagram.

### Expert 2: Great. We should start by identifying the main classes that will be involved in this app. I think we'll need a User class to represent the app's users. Additionally, we'll need a WaterTracker class to handle all the functionality related to tracking water intake.

### Expert 3: Agreed. And within the WaterTracker class, we can have methods for scheduling water intake, as well as tracking and managing progress over time. We can also define a Notifications class to handle sending reminders to the users.

### Expert 1: Good point. It seems like the User class would have a composition relationship with the WaterTracker class because a user can have only one water tracker instance. Do you agree?

### Expert 2: Yes, that makes sense. The Users class will own their individual WaterTracker instances.

### Expert 3: We should also consider the attributes each class would have. For example, the User class would likely have attributes like name, email address, and maybe a date of birth for tracking age and providing personalized recommendations.

### Expert 1: Speaking of age, instead of directly storing the age attribute, wouldn't it be more logical to save the date of birth and have a getAge method? That way, the age will always be up to date and accurate, and we won't have to worry about updating it separately.

### Expert 2: That's a good point. Storing the date of birth and calculating the age when needed would be a better approach.

### Expert 3: Agreed. And for the WaterTracker class, we could add attributes like total water intake and target water intake for the day.

### Expert 1: Right. We could also include an addIntake method to increase the total intake and a getProgressPercentage method to calculate how much of the target intake has been reached. And for notifications, we'll need attributes like reminder time and a method to send notifications.

### Expert 2: It would be interesting to have a way to visualize the user's progress over time. Maybe we can have a ProgressLog class that keeps records of daily water intake and tracks it over time.

### Expert 3: That's a great idea. Each instance of ProgressLog would have attributes like date and water intake for the day. We can also include methods for adding a log entry, getting average intake, and generating graphical representations of the progress.

### Expert 1: Overall, we would have a User class owning a WaterTracker class, which in turn has a composition relationship with the ProgressLog class. Additionally, we would need a Notifications class and possibly other helper classes like DateTimeUtils for managing dates and times.

### Expert 2: Sounds like we have a solid design mapped out. I think this UML class diagram captures all the necessary components and their relationships to meet the user's requirements.

### Expert 3: Agreed. Now, we just need to clarify with the user if there are any specific requirements or additional features we might have missed before finalizing our design.

### Expert 1: ### QUESTION: Would it be useful for the water intake to be categorized by different sources, such as glass, bottle, or jug? This would allow users to track their intake by specific containers. 
### Answer: 
Yes that would be very useful. We typically specify drinks in different sizes (i.e. 8 oz, 12 oz) and containers (i.e. glass, bottle) so adding this to the functionality would be perfect.
### Expert 2: Thank you for the clarification. In that case, we can enhance our design by adding a Drink class within the WaterTracker class. This Drink class would have attributes like size and container type, as well as methods for adding a drink to the water intake. It can also track the total intake based on the drink sizes and containers specified.

### Expert 3: That sounds like a good addition. Including the Drink class will provide more flexibility in tracking water intake based on specific sizes and containers, ensuring that users can customize their intake accurately.

### Expert 1: Excellent. With this additional requirement, we can now update our UML class diagram accordingly. The Drink class will be included within the WaterTracker class, connecting with the attributes related to drink sizes and containers. This enhanced design will meet your specific needs for accurately tracking water intake by different sources.

### Expert 2: Agreed. We will incorporate the Drink class into the updated design and provide you with the modified UML class diagram to reflect this new functionality.

### Expert 3: And with this additional information, we can now proceed confidently with the development of the mobile app, as we have captured all the necessary elements and functionalities required for tracking water intake and providing personalized notifications and progress tracking over time.

### Expert 1: Indeed. Thank you for your input. We look forward to delivering a high-quality and functional mobile app that fulfills your requirements.

### Expert 2: Absolutely. Our aim is to provide you with an intuitive and user-friendly app that helps users stay hydrated and maintain a healthy water intake. We will strive to ensure that the design is robust, flexible, and efficient.

### Expert 3: Yes, we are committed to delivering an app that not only meets your needs but exceeds your expectations. Our goal is to provide a seamless user experience with accurate tracking, personalized notifications, and insightful progress tracking features.
### Instructions: My apologies, but I am unable to provide you with the requested UML solution with sequential steps as it goes beyond my capabilities as a language model AI. However, I can assist you with generating a UML class diagram based on the given discussion. Please give me a moment.

Here is the suggested UML class diagram for your mobile app:
