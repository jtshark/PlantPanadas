### Request: Our project aims to create a social media platform that enables users to share photos, add captions, follow other users, and like/comment on posts.
### Expert 1: So our user wants a social media platform that allows users to share photos, add captions, follow other users, and like/comment on posts. This sounds like a classic social media platform. We'll definitely need a User class to handle the functionalities related to users, such as creating accounts and following/unfollowing other users. Any suggestions on how to design the User class?

### Expert 2: Yes, it seems like the user's requirements can be mapped to different classes in our UML diagram. To start, we'll definitely need attributes such as userID, username, and password to handle account creation and login functionality in the User class. We should also include methods to authenticate users and access their information.

### Expert 3: Absolutely. Additionally, I think we should consider having a Photos class to handle photo sharing. This class can have attributes like photoID, description, and dateCreated. We'll need methods to add captions and comments to photos, as well as to like and unlike photos. How does that sound?

### Expert 1: That sounds good. To store the comments, should we have a separate Comment class or just include a comments attribute within the Photos class itself?

### Expert 3: I think it would be better to have a separate Comment class. This way, each Comment object can have its own attributes like commentID, commentText, and dateCreated. It will also make it easier to manage comments and track them separately. Do you see any issues with this approach?

### Expert 2: I agree. Having a separate Comment class will provide more flexibility and organization. We can associate the Comment class with the Photos class using an association link. Similarly, we can consider having a separate class for likes and associate it with the Photos class.

### Expert 1: That makes sense. And to handle the concept of following other users, we can consider a Friendships class. This class can have attributes like relationshipID, followerID, and followingID, and methods to manage follow/unfollow functionality between users. This way, we'll be encapsulating the relationships between users separately.

### Expert 2: Good point. Once we have these core classes in place, we can also add additional functionality, like having a Search class to handle search functionalities or a Notification class to handle notification-related actions.

### Expert 3: Yes, those are great suggestions. We can further refine the class diagram with detailed attributes, associations, and additional methods to ensure our UML diagram adequately captures all the required functionality.

### Expert 1: Agreed. Let's start putting all these ideas on paper and craft a comprehensive UML class diagram that fulfills the user's requirements. If needed, we can always seek clarification from the user to ensure we capture everything accurately. Once we have the diagram, we can gain a better understanding of how various classes and their interactions will enable the desired functionalities of the social media platform.

### Expert 2: Definitely. We'll need to ensure our diagram is clear and well-structured, taking into consideration any future scalability as well. It's crucial to capture all the necessary attributes and methods to properly model the system.

### Expert 3: Absolutely. And let's remember to document the purpose and responsibilities of the classes and their relationships at each step. This will ensure clarity for both ourselves and future developers who might work on the project.

### Expert 1: Well said. Let's get started on designing this UML class diagram for the social media platform. This is an exciting project, and I'm curious to see the final product.

### Expert 2: Agreed. I'm looking forward to creating a solid foundation for a user-friendly and feature-rich social media platform. It's always fascinating to see how UML can capture complex systems in such a comprehensive and coherent manner.

### Expert 3: Definitely, designing UML class diagrams is always intriguing, especially when it involves creating platforms that connect people. Let's put our expertise to work and deliver a well-structured model for this social media platform.
### Instructions: Step 1: Create a User class.
- Add attributes:
   - userID : String
   - username : String
   - password : String

Step 2: Create methods for the User class.
- addPost(photoID : String, description : String, dateCreated : Date) : void
- deletePost(photoID : String) : void
- likePost(photoID : String) : void
- unlikePost(photoID : String) : void
- commentPost(photoID : String, commentText : String, dateCreated : Date) : void
- authenticate(username : String, password : String) : boolean
- followUser(userID : String) : void
- unfollowUser(userID : String) : void
- getFollowing() : List<User>
- getFollowers() : List<User>

Step 3: Create a Photo class.
- Add attributes:
  - photoID : String
  - description : String
  - dateCreated : Date

Step 4: Create methods for the Photo class.
- addCaption(caption : String) : void
> Note: This method will be used to set the caption associated with a photo.

Step 5: Create a Comment class.
- Add attributes:
  - commentID : String
  - commentText : String
  - dateCreated : Date

Step 6: Create a Like class.
- Add attributes:
  - likeID : String
  - dateCreated : Date

Step 7: Create a Friendships class.
- Add attributes:
  - relationshipID : String
  - followerID : String
  - followingID : String

Step 8: Create methods for the Friendships class.
- followUser(followerID : String, followingID : String) : void
- unfollowUser(followerID : String, followingID : String) : void
- getFollowers(userID: String) : List<User>
- getFollowing(userID: String) : List<User>

Step 9: Add associations between classes.
- User and Photo: One-to-many association indicating that a user can have multiple photos.
                    Implement the association using userID in the User class and photoID in the Photo class.

- Photo and Comment: One-to-many association indicating that a photo can have multiple comments.
                      Implement the association using photoID in the Photo class and commentID in the Comment class.

- Photo and Like: One-to-many association indicating that a photo can have multiple likes.
                  Implement the association using photoID in the Photo class and likeID in the Like class.

- User and Friendships: Many-to-many association, as each user can have multiple friends and be friends with multiple users.
                        Implement the association using relationshipID in the Friendships class, followerID and followingID in the User class.



Congratulations! You have successfully designed a UML class diagram addressing the requirements to create a social media platform.
