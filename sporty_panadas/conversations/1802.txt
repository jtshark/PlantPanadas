### Request: Develop an e-commerce website that allows customers to search and purchase products, add items to their shopping cart, choose items in different quantities, use promo codes, and check out securely.
### Expert 1: So, we need to design a UML class diagram for an e-commerce website. The user requirements include searching for and purchasing products, adding items to a shopping cart, choosing quantities, applying promo codes, and checking out securely. 

### Expert 2: Right, let's start with the customer class. It could have attributes like name, email, and password to hold customer information.

### Expert 3: Agreed. Additionally, we can add a ShoppingCart class which will store the selected products. It could have attributes like totalPrice, promoCode, and an array of Product instances.

### Expert 1: Sounds good. The Product class can have attributes like name, description, price, and quantity. We can also include a method called getTotalPrice, which multiplies the price by the quantity to provide the overall cost of individual products.

### Expert 2: To handle promo codes, we can add an additional class called PromoCode. It would have attributes like code and discountPercentage. 

### Expert 3: Should we store the discounted price of each product separately or use a method to calculate it when needed?

### Expert 1: Given that the discount may change or vary over time, it would be better to store the discount in the PromoCode class and use a method to calculate the discounted price when needed. This way, we ensure that we only need to update the discount percentage in one place.

### Expert 2: That makes sense. So, we'll have a method in the Product class, let's call it getDiscountedPrice, which will calculate the discounted price using the promo code and return it.

### Expert 3: Agreed. Now, what about the shopping cart? How should we handle adding items with different quantities to the cart?

### Expert 1: We can include a method in the ShoppingCart class called addItem, which will take a Product instance and the desired quantity as parameters. It will then add the product to the cart with the specified quantity.

### Expert 2: So, when the user wants to add an item to the shopping cart, we will create a Product instance and pass it along with the quantity to the addItem method?

### Expert 1: Yes, exactly. The ShoppingCart class will manage the array of Product instances and provide methods to update or remove items as needed.

### Expert 3: And when it comes time to check out and make a payment securely, how should we handle that?

### Expert 1: We can design a separate class called Payment which will manage secure payments and validation. It could include methods like makePayment where we process the payment using a payment gateway and verify the transaction.

### Expert 2: Sounds good. We can add a method in the ShoppingCart class, let's call it checkout, which would invoke the required logic from the Payment class to finalize the transaction.

### Expert 3: Should we store the overall purchase history per customer or assume they can retrieve it separately, like viewing order history?

### Expert 1: Storing the purchase history for each customer is a good idea, but it would be a separate functionality and out of scope for now. We can assume that users can retrieve their order history separately from our system.

### Expert 2: Alright, so I think we covered all user requirements. Now, the class diagram should include Customer, ShoppingCart, Product, PromoCode, and Payment classes.

### Expert 3: Sounds great. We can also include association lines between the classes to indicate their relationships. For example, from Customer to ShoppingCart to indicate that a customer can have a shopping cart.

### Expert 1: And we can link ShoppingCart to Product to show that it manages a collection of product instances. Additionally, we can associate PromoCode with ShoppingCart to indicate that a promo code can be applied during checkout.

### Expert 2: Great! I think we have a solid plan here. We should also remember to clarify any details we are uncertain about with the user before finalizing the design.

### Expert 3: Agreed. Following up with the user and asking clarifying questions will help ensure that our UML class diagram accurately reflects their needs and requirements.
### Instructions: 1. Create the "Customer" class with attributes: name, email, and password.
2. Create the "Product" class with attributes: name, description, price, and quantity. Include a method called "getTotalPrice" to calculate the overall cost for individual products.
3. Create the "PromoCode" class with attributes: code and discountPercentage.
4. Add a method called "getDiscountedPrice" in the "Product" class to calculate the discounted price using the promo code and return it.
5. Create the "ShoppingCart" class with attributes: totalPrice, promoCode, and an array of Product instances.
6. Implement a method called "addItem" in the "ShoppingCart" class which should take a Product instance along with the desired quantity as parameters, then add the product to the cart with the specified quantity.
7. Create the "Payment" class to handle secure payments and validation. Include a method called "makePayment" to process the payment using a payment gateway and verify the transaction.
8. Implement a method called "checkout" in the "ShoppingCart" class that invokes the necessary logic from the Payment class to finalize the transaction.
9. Create associations in the class diagram to represent the relationships between the classes - include an association between Customer and ShoppingCart to indicate that a customer can have a shopping cart, a composition association between ShoppingCart and Product to show that it manages a collection of product instances, and another association between PromoCode and ShoppingCart to indicate that a promo code can be applied during checkout.
