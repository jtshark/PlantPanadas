### Request: Our project is focused on developing a mobile application that allows users to make reservations at a restaurant, view the menu, order food and beverages to go or for dine-in, leave reviews, and pay their check using the app.
### Expert 1: So, we are designing a UML class diagram for a restaurant reservation and ordering system. Let's start by identifying the main classes we'll need.

### Expert 2: Agreed. We should have a "User" class to represent the people using the app. And we'll also need a "Restaurant" class to represent the individual restaurants.

### Expert 3: Good start. In addition to those classes, we should have a "Reservation" class to handle the booking of tables, and maybe a "Review" class to represent the feedback left by users.

### Expert 1: Absolutely. We will also need a class to manage the menu items. Perhaps we can call it "MenuItem".

### Expert 2: I agree. And to complete the picture, we might want a class to handle the ordering process. We can call it "Order".

### Expert 3: Great. We've covered the main classes. Now, we should think about the relationships between these classes. For instance, the "Restaurant" class should have a one-to-many association with the "Menu" class because each restaurant will have multiple menu items.

### Expert 1: Right. And since each user can potentially leave multiple reviews, there should be a one-to-many association between the "User" and "Review" classes.

### Expert 2: Makes sense. Also, each reservation will be linked to a specific user and a specific restaurant, so we'll need two many-to-one associations between the "Reservation" class and the "User" and "Restaurant" classes.

### Expert 3: Agreed. And what about the "Order" class? It seems like it should have associations with the "User", "MenuItem", and "Restaurant" classes.

### Expert 1: I think you're correct. Since an order can have multiple menu items, we can use a one-to-many association between the "Order" and "MenuItem" classes. And each order will be associated with one user and one restaurant, so we can have two many-to-one associations here as well.

### Expert 2: Nice. We are making progress. Now, we also need attributes for each class. For example, the "User" class could have attributes like name, email, and password.

### Expert 3: Yes, agreed. And the "Restaurant" class could have attributes such as name, address, and contact information.

### Expert 1: Right. The "Review" class could have attributes like date, text, and maybe even a rating.

### Expert 2: Good point. And beyond that, the "MenuItem" class could have attributes like name, description, and price.

### Expert 3: Exactly. And the "Order" class could have attributes such as order date, order status, and maybe even a unique order ID.

### Expert 1: I think we are off to a good start. Before finalizing the UML diagram, should we go over our design and see if there are any ambiguities or missing elements?

### Expert 2: Agreed. It seems we've covered most of the main entities, attributes, and relationships. But I do have one question. Would it be more logical to save a date of birth attribute for users instead of directly storing the age?

### Expert 3: That's an interesting point. By storing the date of birth, we can easily calculate the age whenever needed. This approach is preferable since the age can constantly change but the date of birth remains constant. Let's add this consideration to our diagram.

### Expert 1: Good find. Let's incorporate the date of birth attribute for the "User" class and the method to calculate age. We can annotate it in the UML diagram.

### Expert 3: Agreed. We should also add methods in the "Order" class to handle adding and removing menu items, calculating the total bill, and processing the payment.

### Expert 2: That makes sense. These methods will improve the usability and functionality of our system. So, we'll add them to the "Order" class. 

### Expert 1: Great. Let's update and finalize the UML diagram incorporating all these recommendations and submit it for review. It seems like we're on the right track to meet the user's requirements.
### Instructions: Solution:

Step 1: Identify the main classes needed for the UML class diagram:
- User
- Restaurant
- Reservation
- Review
- MenuItem
- Order

Step 2: Define the attributes for each class:
User:
- Name
- Email
- Password
- Date of birth

Restaurant:
- Name
- Address
- Contact information

Reservation:
- Reservation date/time
- Number of guests
- User (association)

Review:
- Date
- Text
- Rating
- Restaurant (association)
- User (association)

MenuItem:
- Name
- Description
- Price
- Restaurant (association)

Order:
- Order date/time
- Order status
- Total bill amount
- User (association)
- Restaurant (association)

Step 3: Create associations between the classes:
- "Restaurant" has a one-to-many association with "MenuIterm"
- "User" has a one-to-many association with "Review"
- "Reservation" has a many-to-one association with "User" and "Restaurant"
- "Review" has a many-to-one association with "User" and "Restaurant"
- "Order" hast a one-to-many association with "MenuItem" and many-to-one associations with "User" and "Restaurant"

Step 4: Add additional methods or operations:
- In the "Order" class, add methods for adding and removing menu items, calculating the total bill, and processing payment.

Step 5: Update the User class following the recommendation made during the discussion:
- remove the 'Age' attribute
- add 'Date of birth' attribute
