### Request: I need an UML model for a mobile app that will allow users to create and share custom workout routines with friends. The app should also include tracking of progress, reminders and social media integration.
### Expert 1: Okay, let's start by designing a UML class diagram for the mobile app. We have a few requirements: creating and sharing workout routines, tracking progress, reminders, and social media integration. So, the main entities I can think of are User, Workout, Progress, Reminder, and SocialMedia.

### Expert 2: That sounds like a good starting point. We can start by representing the User class. It will have attributes such as username, email, and password. To create and share workout routines, I suggest adding a Routine class that has attributes like name, exercises, and an association to the User class.

### Expert 3: That makes sense. And we can also include a separate Exercise class that has attributes like name, description, and duration. The Routine class can have a composition association with the Exercise class because an exercise belongs to a specific routine.

### Expert 1: Right. Moving on to tracking progress, we should add a Progress class with attributes like date, weight lifted, and number of repetitions. The Progress class should have a composition association with the User class since a user can have multiple progress updates.

### Expert 2: Additionally, it might be helpful to include a Tracking class to keep track of the routine followed by the user. This class can have attributes like date and completion status, along with an association to the User and Routine classes.

### Expert 3: Good suggestion. To implement reminders, we can introduce a Reminder class with attributes like description and time. The Reminder class should have an association with the User class so that users can create and manage their reminders.

### Expert 1: Finally, for social media integration, we can include a SocialMedia class. This class can have attributes such as the user's social media handles and a method to share the routine. It should be associated with the User and Routine classes.

### Expert 2: I agree. Overall, this UML class diagram will help us define the structure and associations between the different entities in the mobile app. It covers the key functionalities requested by the user, including creating and sharing workout routines, tracking progress, reminders, and social media integration.

### Expert 3: Absolutely. With this diagram, we can further discuss the functionalities and verify if we need any additional clarification from the user. Are there any areas where we might need more details?

### Expert 1: One area that could use more clarification is the nature of the social media integration. Should users be able to share their routines on specific social media platforms or just provide generic sharing functionality?

### Instructions: Step-by-step solution for designing the UML Class Diagram:

1. Start by creating a User class with the following attributes:
   - username: String
   - email: String
   - password: String

2. Create a Routine class with the following attributes:
   - name: String
   - exercises: Exercise[]
   - difficultyLevel: String
   
3. Create an Exercise class with the following attributes:
   - name: String
   - description: String
   - duration: int

4. Add associations between classes:
   a. User and Routine: User has 0 to many Routines; Routine has 1 User.
   b. Routine and Exercise: Routine has 1 to many Exercises; Exercise belongs to 1 Routine.
   c. User and Progress: User has 0 to many Progress updates; Progress belongs to 1 User.
   d. User and Reminder: User has 0 to many Reminders; Reminder has 1 User.
   e. User and SocialMedia: User has 0 to many SocialMedia handles; SocialMedia can share public routines info.

5. Define the Progress class with the following attributes:
   - date: Date
   - weightLifted: double
   - repetitions: int
   
6. Create the Reminder class with the following attributes:
   - description: String
   - time: Time/Date
   
7. Design the SocialMedia class with the following attributes:
   - socialMediaHandles: String[]
   
Great! You have successfully designed a UML class diagram for a mobile app that allows users to create and share custom workout routines with friends, tracks progress, provides reminders, and has social media integration.
