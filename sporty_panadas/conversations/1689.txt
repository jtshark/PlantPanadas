### Request: My project is to create a mobile app for a running club that lets users track their runs, chat with other club members, and view upcoming events on a calendar.
### Expert 1: So, based on the user request, It seems like we need to design a UML class diagram for a mobile app that includes features like tracking runs, chatting with other members, and a calendar for upcoming events.

### Expert 2: Exactly. It's crucial to design the class diagram properly to ensure that the app handles all these functionalities effectively. Let's start with the basic class that represents the users. We'll need attributes like name, age, and email for each user.

### Expert 3: Agreed. Additionally, we should consider adding authentication related fields like username and password to ensure secure access to the app.

### Expert 1: That makes sense. Now, we can include a class for runs. It will need attributes such as date, distance, duration, and maybe even speed. Users should be able to track new runs and access their existing run history.

### Expert 2: Good point. We could also have a separate class for tracking GPS coordinates for each run, allowing us to map the route over time.

### Expert 3: Right. Moving on, how about adding a class for chatting functionality? We could include attributes like message sender, receiver, content, and timestamps.

### Expert 1: Absolutely. We might also consider adding a class for events. It would include attributes such as the event name, location, date, and maybe even a description.

### Expert 2: Agreed. Additionally, there could be a separate class for club members, which would allow users to join or leave the club. It can include a relationship to the event class as well.

### Expert 3: True. To match the requirement of displaying events on a calendar, we could include a class for a calendar itself. This class may provide methods to add, remove, and retrieve events.

### Expert 1: Indeed. However, instead of hard-coding the date attribute in the event class, would it be better to save the date of birth attribute in the user class? And provide a method to retrieve the user's age based on their date of birth?

### Expert 2: That sounds logical. By storing the date of birth rather than the age, we ensure that the age will always be up to date without needing to manually update the value every year.

### Expert 3: Exactly. That way, when users want to find the average age of club members, they can easily calculate it based on all the users' date of birth attributes.

### Expert 1: Absolutely. Similarly, instead of having separate attributes for price and discounted price in the event class, would it be better to have a discount percentage attribute in the event class, and use a method to calculate the discounted price when needed?

### Expert 2: That makes more sense. We want to minimize redundancy in the data structure and calculations. By storing the percentage, we can easily calculate the discounted price as and when required.

### Expert 3: That's a good point. It also allows future modifications regarding discounts without the need to update all the existing events with the new discounted price.

### Expert 1: Precisely. So based on our discussion, the suggested classes for our UML class diagram should be User, Run, GPSCoordinates, Chat, Event, ClubMember, and Calendar. Do we have any further questions?

### Expert 2: I have one question actually. How detailed do you think the Chat class should be? Should we include features like read receipts or indicate when a message has been delivered?


### Instructions: Solution:

1. Create a User class with attributes: name, age, email, username, and password.
2. Create a Run class with attributes: date, distance, duration, and speed.
3. Create a GPSCoordinates class with attributes for tracking latitude and longitude over time.
4. Create a Chat class with attributes: sender, receiver, content, and timestamps.
5. Create an Event class with attributes: event name, location, date, and description.
6. Create a ClubMember class to represent the members of the running club.
7. Create a Calendar class with methods to add, remove, and retrieve events.
8. Add a method to the User class to calculate the age based on the date of birth attribute.
9. Add an attribute to the Event class for discountPercentage and create a method to calculate the discounted price.
10. Add relationships between classes: 
    - User has a relationship with Run and Chat classes.
    - Event has a relationship with ClubMember and Calendar classes.
11. Optionally, consider adding features like read receipts or delivery indication in the Chat class.

This sequence provides a clear step-by-step process incorporating each discussed aspect into the class diagram design.
