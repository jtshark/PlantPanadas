### Request: Our project is a mobile app that allows users to track their daily water intake, set reminders for drinking water, and view their water consumption history in a graph.
### Expert 1: So our app is all about tracking water intake, setting reminders, and displaying consumption history. It seems like our main entities are User, WaterIntake, Reminder, and ConsumptionGraph. What other classes do you think we may need?

### Expert 2: Well, apart from those entities, we should also consider a WaterTracker class which will serve as the main controller or manager for all the functionality related to tracking water intake. This class can have methods to add a new water intake, set a reminder, and generate the consumption graph.

### Expert 3: I agree with you, ### Expert 2. Additionally, we should include a Notification class to handle sending reminders to users. This class can contain methods related to sending notification messages, such as sending a reminder to drink water at scheduled intervals.

### Expert 1: Great suggestions so far. Now let's think about the attributes of our classes. For the User class, it should have attributes like name, age, and gender. 

### Expert 3: Definitely, we'll also need an attribute for user data, such as weight or height, to calculate the recommended daily water intake for each user.

### Expert 2: Good point, ### Expert 3. It might be better to store the date of birth instead of age itself. That way, we can calculate the age dynamically when needed.

### Expert 1: That makes sense. So we'll have a method called getAge in the User class that calculates the age based on the date of birth attribute. This way, we don't need to update the age every time it changes.

### Expert 3: Exactly. Plus, storing the date of birth gives us flexibility in the future if we decide to add more features that require age calculations.

### Expert 2: Agreed. Moving on to the WaterIntake class, it should have attributes like date, time, and amount. Additionally, we can define a method to calculate the total water intake for a specific period, like a day or a week.

### Expert 1: We also need to account for reminders. The Reminder class could have attributes like date, time, and frequency. This will help users set reminders to drink water at specific times throughout the day.

### Expert 3: That's right. And in order to display the consumption history in a graph, we should have a method in the ConsumptionGraph class that fetches data from the WaterIntake class and generates the graph based on it.

### Expert 2: Absolutely. We can utilize a graphing library or create our own graphing algorithm depending on the design specifications of the app.

### Expert 1: Before we finalize everything, should we clarify if the user wants a feature to set custom water intake goals?

### Expert 3: Good call, ### Expert 1. Setting custom water intake goals could be useful for those who have specific hydration requirements. Let's get some clarification.

### QUESTION: Do you want to include a feature that allows users to set custom water intake goals? This way, they can track their progress towards achieving their own target. 
### Answer:  Yes, that would be great! A feature like this would definitely be a huge help.
### Expert 1: Thank you for the clarification. In that case, we can add an attribute for water intake goal in the User class. This way, users can set their personal target and track their progress towards achieving it.

### Expert 2: To keep track of progress, we can add a method in the User class that calculates the percentage of the goal achieved based on the total water intake.

### Expert 3: That sounds like a good plan. With this feature, users will have the flexibility to set their own personalized water intake goals, making the app more tailored to their needs.

### Expert 1: Agreed. I think we've covered the main functionalities of the system. Now we just need to determine the relationships between these classes. 

### Expert 2: The User class will have a one-to-many relationship with the WaterIntake, Reminder, and ConsumptionGraph classes, as each user can have multiple instances of water intake, reminders, and consumption graphs.

### Expert 3: Additionally, the WaterTracker class will have associations with all the other classes as it will interact with them to perform various operations. It's like the central hub for accessing and modifying data related to water tracking.

### Expert 1: Right. And the Notification class will have a dependency relationship with the Reminder class, as it relies on the reminders to send notifications to the user.

### Expert 2: These relationships between classes will provide a clear structure and allow us to organize the system effectively.

### Expert 3: Absolutely. It's crucial to establish these relationships to ensure seamless communication and data flow between the different components of the system.

### Expert 1: I think we've covered everything. We have the necessary classes, attributes, methods, and relationships to design a UML Class Diagram for our app. Shall we proceed with documenting it?

### Expert 2: Yes, let's start creating the UML Class Diagram based on our discussion. We can refer back to it during the development phase to ensure we fulfill all the requirements.

### Expert 3: Agreed. Taking the time to design it properly will definitely benefit us in the long run. Let's get started then!

### Expert 1: Great. I'll start working on the UML diagram based on our conversation. Thank you both for your valuable input.
### Instructions: Step-by-step Solution for Designing the Class Diagram:

1. Identify the main entities/classes mentioned in the discussion: User, WaterIntake, Reminder, ConsumptionGraph, WaterTracker, and Notification. 
2. Create these classes in your UML diagram.

   Note: If any class has already been created during previous steps, skip this step.

3. Define the attributes for the User class as mentioned in the discussion: name, dateOfBirth, weight(or height), and waterIntakeGoal.
4. Add these attributes to the User class in the UML diagram.

   Note: Do not forget to specify the data types of the attributes.

5. Define the attributes for the WaterIntake class: date, time, and amount.
6. Add these attributes to the WaterIntake class.
   
7. Define the attributes for the Reminder class: date, time, and frequency.
8. Add these attributes to the Reminder class.

9. There may be additional attributes unique to some classes such as Time for Notification class and attributes for graph visualization library for ConsumptionGraph class. Add these attributes if required.

10. Identify the necessary relationships between the classes based on the discussion.

   Note: Restrictions such as aggregation or composition (indicated by a diamond-shaped symbol).

11. User has a one-to-many relationship with each of the following classes: WaterIntake, Reminder, and ConsumptionGraph. 
  - Draw association lines with multiplicity (1 or 0..* where appropriate) between User class and these classes.
  
12. Ensure that Notification class has a dependency relationship with the Reminder class.
   - Draw a dashed arrow from Notification to Reminder indicating the dependency.
    
13. Use the WaterTracker class to link/manage all functionalities related to tracking water intake.
   - Draw a simple association line from WaterTracker class to User, WaterIntake, Reminder, and ConsumptionGraph classes.
    
14. At this stage, review your class diagram to ensure it correctly depicts the structure and relationships discussed.

15. (Optional) Consider adding methods as required by analyzing the behavior of each class. (However, the discussion did not mention any specific methods.)

16. Save, finalize, and document the completed UML Class Diagram as per your project's documentation requirements.

Remember to adjust the steps to fit your particular development process or tools, if necessary.
Once the class diagram has been created, it can serve as a reference for designing and implementing the mobile app.
