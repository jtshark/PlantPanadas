### Request: Our project is designing a car garage management app, that allows users to schedule appointments for maintenance and repairs, keep track of service history, and receive notifications for upcoming appointments.
### Expert 1: So it looks like our user needs a car garage management app that can handle appointment scheduling, service history, and notifications. This sounds like a good candidate for designing a UML class diagram. How should we start?

### Expert 2: We should identify the main entities involved in the car garage management system. I think we can start with a "Customer" class to represent the app users. It would store their relevant information like name, contact details, and possibly login credentials.

### Expert 3: That makes sense. I can also see a need for a "Car" class to represent each customer's vehicle. This class can have attributes such as make, model, year, and license plate number.

### Expert 1: Right, we also need an "Appointment" class to handle scheduling. It should have a date and time attribute and reference the related "Customer" and "Car" objects.

### Expert 2: Agreed. We should consider including a "Service" class as well, which can have attributes like description, duration, and price. It would be associated with each "Appointment" to provide more information on what maintenance or repair needs to take place.

### Expert 3: We might also want a "ServiceHistory" class to store past services for each "Car" object. This would allow customers to get a complete record of all services performed.

### Expert 1: Makes sense. Now, what about the notifications? We could add a "Notification" class to handle reminders for upcoming appointment dates and times.

### Expert 2: That's a good idea. We can keep it simple, with attributes like notification message and expiration date. It would be linked to the "Appointment" class to target the relevant customer.

### Expert 3: One aspect I can see causing ambiguity is storing the actual date of birth for the "Customer" class. Do you think it would be better to directly store their age or provide a method to calculate the age based on the date of birth?

### Expert 1: Storing the date of birth directly makes more sense because it captures more precise information. We can then include a method like "getAge()" that calculates the customer's age based on the stored birth date.

### Expert 2: I agree, and it's good practice to keep the underlying data consistent and meaningful. Plus, if we stored just the age, we wouldn't have enough information for generating accurate statistics or identifying customer age groups.

### Expert 3: That's true, storing the date of birth gives us more flexibility in the long run. Another interesting problem is handling discounts for services. Would it be better to save a discount directly or the actual price and a separate attribute for the discount amount?

### Expert 1: It depends on the use case. If we only ever have discounts on services applied to the original price, then storing the original price and a discount amount would make more sense. This way, the "Service" class could have attributes like 'price' and 'discountAmount.'

### Expert 2: However, if we foresee cases where there might be multiple types of discounts or differences in how they're applied, it might be more advantageous to have a separate "Discount" class. This class could define different discount types, each with its own attributes such as the discount rate or any conditions for eligibility.

### Expert 3: I see your point. By separating the discount logic, we can handle different types of discounts more easily and potentially extend them in the future if needed. It would also help isolate the responsibility for managing discounts from other classes.

### Expert 1: Definitely. A "Discount" class gives us more flexibility and ensures proper encapsulation of discount-related concerns. It simplifies calculations and gives us the ability to modify discount behavior in one place without modifying all "Service" objects directly.

### Expert 2: Right, and we can then have a method in the "Service" class to calculate the discounted price based on both the original price and any associated discount.

### Expert 3: I agree. Separating concerns and keeping our design flexible is essential. We want to be able to modify or extend our code without causing cascading changes throughout the system.

### Expert 1: Absolutely. So far, we have identified the "Customer," "Car," "Appointment," "Service," "ServiceHistory," "Notification," "Discount," and possibly other classes. It seems like we have a good start on our UML class diagram for the car garag
### Instructions: 1. Create a "Customer" class with attributes such as name, contact details, and login credentials.
2. Create a "Car" class with attributes like make, model, year, and license plate number.
3. Create an "Appointment" class with attributes for date and time. Link it to the "Customer" and "Car" classes to establish associations.
4. Create a "Service" class with attributes like description, duration, price, and possibly a separate "Discount" class for applying discounts. Associate it with the "Appointment" class.
5. Create a "ServiceHistory" class linked to the "Car" class to store the past services each vehicle has undergone.
6. Add a "Notification" class with attributes for message and expiration date, and link it to the "Appointment" class for reminders.
7. Consider adding a method, such as `getAge()`, in the "Customer" class to calculate age based on the birthdate attribute.
8. Define the necessary associations between these classes (e.g., a one-to-many association between "Customer" and "Car," a one-to-many association between "Customer" and "Appointment," and a one-to-many association between "Car" and "ServiceHistory").
9. Ensure encapsulation by setting proper access modifiers for the classes' attributes and methods, implementing getters and setters when required.
10. Consider additional methods or behaviors specific to each class that are necessary for proper functionality, such as addService(), removeService(), and updateService() in the "ServiceHistory" class, or computeDiscountedPrice() in the "Service" class.
11. Verify the consistency and appropriateness of the class diagram, making any adjustments or refinements as needed.
12. If required, consider adding other classes to handle features like payment processing, inventory management, or employee schedules, depending on the project's requirements.
13. Review, validate, and refine the class diagram to ensure adherence to the project's defined specifications and user needs.
